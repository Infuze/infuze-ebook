## Gulp tasks

The default gulp requires the --book argument, for example
```
Gulp --book 1
```
... will deploy book 1 by copying to the **deploy** folder.
```
Gulp --book 1,2,4
```
... will deploy books 1, 2 & 4 by copying them to the **deploy** folder.
```
Gulp --book all
```
... will deploy **all** books by copying them to the **deploy** folder.
