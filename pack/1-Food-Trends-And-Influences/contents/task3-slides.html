                  <p>The advent of travel and people’s interest in gastronomy has provided the hospitality industry with a plethora of opportunities to deliver very different dining experiences the world over.</p>
                  <p>Understanding their similarities and differences allows professional chefs to consider their careers and to focus their training.</p>
                  <p>The dining experiences also include the different types of meals available and the characteristics of these meals.</p>

            <p>There are many different types of dining experiences and a professional chef should clearly understand the similarities and differences between them.</p>
            <h3 class="page-h3">Fine dining</h3>
            <p>Considered to be the jewel in the crown for gastronomy lovers, these are generally established restaurants with set menus and expensive surroundings. The cost of eating in these restaurants is normally
              £150+ per person. Chefs tend to be well known (celebrity), and bookings can be difficult to secure. Examples include:</p>

            <p>Pub cooking is generally confined to the UK but has established in other countries where there is a British influence. Food is now considered the driving force in this type of experience, whereas it used
              to be the drink. Within the UK there has been a explosion of this type of eatery, especially by large organisations and chain restaurants.</p>
            <p>Gastro pubs are generally pubs providing a fine dining experience in a different surrounding. Many renowned chefs now also run gastro pubs in the UK:</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Bistros/brasseries</h3>

            <p>In the UK, bistros and brasseries are often referred to as restaurants that provide a continental flavour on their menus. The French use the terms to describe cheap wholesome food. Within the UK this
              experience will provide a quality product that is not inexpensive.</p>
            <p>This type of establishment is generally well decorated, airy and the staff are well trained, both front of house and chefs. Some examples include:</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Chains/branded</h3>

            <p>Chains and branded dining experiences can crossover into many areas of the hospitality industry. This type of establishment provides clientele with a standardised food product wherever they are served in
              the country.</p>
            <p>In some cases the product is made centrally and the sites used as finishing kitchens. Included in this category are:</p>

            <p>Themed restaurants aim to deliver customers the whole experience. The idea is to provide customers with an establishment where the theme covers everything including the décor, food, music, staff etc.</p>
            <p>There are chains of themed restaurants but also individual sites (such as in London). Some examples include:</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Ethnic dining</h3>

            <p>Ethnic dining covers a vast array of different experiences – from fast food to high-end dining. Restaurants tend to specialise in their own cultural and ethnic dishes. The decor in these establishments
              can be either complementary or not, unlike a themed restaurant.</p>
            <p>Examples of this type of eatery can be found in most towns in the UK and include:</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Fast food</h3>

            <p>Fast food can best be described as a quick bite to eat. The food is ordered at a computer terminal or counter, collected by the customer, eaten at the table and then their trays are cleared by the
              customer themselves.</p>
            <p>Characteristically the staff are generally young, move on quickly and are trained to do specific tasks. Turnover is high and food is cheap. There are a number of big players in the UK:</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Takeaways</h3>

            <p>Takeaway establishments can be found in all towns and cities and are best described as outlets that provide food to be eaten off the premises. Their overheads are small so the food products are generally
              cheap.</p>
            <p>The experience provided by a takeaway varies greatly as the food is diverse and not generally high quality. Examples include:</p>

            <p>Wedding catering has evolved from a wedding breakfast in a hotel or restaurant to eating BBQ in teepee tents surrounded by guests and family. Characteristically, food at events tend to be expensive, no

            <p>In-house catering is generally the term used for organisations that provide a dining experience for their workforce. This provision has two benefits – providing nutrition to the workforce and keeping the
              workforce on site.</p>
            <p>The type of dining experience is generally seen as cafeteria style – customers collect their own food and return their crockery and cutlery after finishing their meals. The food is sometimes subsidised
              and offers good value for money. This dining experience can be seen at:</p>

            <p>Street food is meant to be eaten immediately, using fingers or supplied plastic cutlery. It is cheap and often of ethnic origin. Street food vendors might sell:</p>

              <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2;">

                <div class="page-u-list">
                  <ul>
                    <li>One star – Very good cooking in its category</li>
                    <li>Two stars – Excellent cooking, worth a detour</li>
                    <li>Three stars – Exceptional cuisine, worthy of a special journey</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <p>In the UK, three Michelin stars have been awarded to:</p>

                <div class="page-u-list">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester</li>
                    <li>Gordon Ramsey – Chelsea</li>
                    <li>The Fat Duck – Bray</li>

                  </ul>
                </div>

              </div>

              <div class="page-col-2-2">

              </div>

            </div>

            <p>Two stars have been awarded to 20 restaurants in the UK. The regions they represent include:</p>

            <div class="page-u-list">
              <ul>
                <li>London</li>
                <li>Cambridgeshire</li>
                <li>Cornwall</li>
                <li>Devon</li>
                <li>Perthshire</li>
                <li>Oxfordshire</li>
                <li>Durham</li>
                <li>Wiltshire</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>One star has been issued to 138 establishments across the UK with 18 new recipients. Restaurants also lose their stars and this can have a dramatic effect on their reputation and therefore turnover.</p>
            <p>Michelin stars are not always wanted and the enfant terrible of British Cooking, Marco Pierre White, returned his three stars complaining he was doing more to please the inspectors than himself.</p>
