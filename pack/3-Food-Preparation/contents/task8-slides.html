                            <p>The food is cooked until it reaches the proper doneness and develops a golden brown exterior and moist interior. Tender cuts of meat are the most suitable for roasting.</p>

                            <p>An early form of roasting that is still used is to cook the meat on a rod over an open fire. To provide even roasting the rod is turned, manually or by a motor, during cooking. This process is known as rotisserie cooking.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> When choosing a chicken for roasting, it is best to select an older bird with more muscle, flavour and fat. Fat is favourable for roasting because it adds flavour and moisture to the meat as it is cooking, and will eventually melt off during the cooking process.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Roasting is accomplished by cooking the poultry uncovered in a hot oven. The chicken or turkey is cleaned, seasoned, stuffed (optional), and then placed on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. The rack is not essential, but it will improve the quality by holding the bird out of the juices and allowing the heat to reach evenly around the entire bird, resulting in a chicken that is golden brown on all sides.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Barding</strong> is a method of placing fat, such as bacon or strips of pork fat, around lean meats or poultry that are to be roasted, so that they absorb additional moisture and fat which keeps them from drying out. The barded fat bastes the meat while it is roasting, adding flavour, especially to lean cuts which lack sufficient fat to remain moist and succulent.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Barding is only necessary when the meat does not have enough natural fat. The barding strip can either be laid over the meat or secured with cooking string and positioned in a location best suited to be absorbed by the meat.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are roasted, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example is deboning a leg of lamb before stuffing, tying and roasting.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Searing/browning:</strong> The process of quickly browning the surface of food by exposing it to extremely high heat. For instance, meat is typically seared in a small quantity of oil and then roasted in the oven. The meat is seared to provide a flavourful brown outer crust on its surface as the natural sugars cook and caramelise. This is known as the Maillard reaction.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> It is essential that meat, poultry or vegetables to be roasted are thoroughly seasoned before the cooking process, to enable the flavours to soak through.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stuffing:</strong> Stuffing typically involves placing cubes or crumbled pieces of dried, seasoned bread into the cavity of the meat; or a space is made in the raw meat and the stuffing mixture is tucked inside. Convenience stuffing mix generally consists of white bread, wheat bread or a combination of both, and is seasoned with herbs and spices.</li>

                            <li><strong>Trussing:</strong> Trussing involves tying the meat or poultry with cooking string, which may be woven through the parts of a bird with a trussing needle in order to create a more compact shape suitable for roasting. Typically, the wings and legs of poultry are tied or trussed securely against the body to allow the bird to be evenly cooked. Trussing utensils may also include skewers or pins, used instead of string to hold the bird parts together.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tying:</strong> Tying various cuts of meat and poultry is a good way to hold the shape of a roast, to keep the meat in a compact form, and to make sure that the meat will be cooked evenly.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">The tying allows the roast to be stuffed and makes for a more attractive presentation when serving. When tying meat and poultry, it is important that the string is tight enough so that the desired shape is held in place, but not so tight that the natural juices will be squeezed from the meat during the cooking process.</li>

                            <li><strong>Basting:</strong> Basting is the process of moistening food (especially meat) during roasting, typically using butter or meat juices. This can be done by spooning the liquid over the food periodically as it cooks, or by brushing it on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Positioning within oven:</strong> Just as in baking, it is important to remember that an oven may have ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ areas. Using a fan assisted (convection) oven means the fans will distribute hot air around the oven, which helps to cook the food more evenly.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">A conventional gas or electric style oven will have areas within the oven that are hotter than others. Hot air rises, so the top of the oven will always be hottest and the bottom of the oven will be slightly cooler. During the cooking process you may need to move items around in order to get the best possible heat. Whenever possible, try to position the items centrally.</li>

                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> Temperature control is important to the roasting process. Always preheat your oven before roasting in order to ensure the food goes in at the correct temperature for the correct time, as per the recipe.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is very important at all stages of handling, preparation and cooking of foods for roasting that the temperature of the foods is monitored to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. Prior to cooking, all foods for roasting should be stored in the correct cold refrigeration at a temperature of 3&#176;C– 8&#176;C until required. All food should be thoroughly heated and kept out of the temperature danger zone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Turning:</strong> When roasting food such as vegetables, it is important to regularly toss or turn the items to ensure even colouring and cooking and avoid over-browning. This can easily be done using a slice, a pair of tongs or a carving fork.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to the recipe cooking time. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of roasted products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook, and that they are not undercooked when removed from the oven.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing roasted foods, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing roasted products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish. For example, a roast chicken could be garnished with bread sauce, a stuffing ball, fried breadcrumbs, halved roasted tomatoes and watercress.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> A roasted joint of meat could be pre-sliced into individual portions, for ease of service.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Resting:</strong> Resting allows the juices from roasted meat to be reabsorbed into the flesh, making it tender and preventing the juices from leaking when the meat is cut.</li>
                            <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing roasted products. Like garnishing, it adds flavour and texture, improving the appearance of the overall dish. For example, roast beef could be served with horseradish sauce and jus lie, or roast chicken could be served with a bread sauce and jus lie.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is important that a suitable and correct sauce is used when saucing roasted products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing.</li>
