                            <p>There are many methods for cooking seafood. It is important to cook the seafood according to the recipe and apply the <strong>correct method of cookery</strong>, for example roasting, stir or pan frying, grilling or baking, for dry heat cookery methods and braising, steaming, poaching for moist heat cookery methods.</p>

                            <p>Ensure you cook the seafood, so it is just cooked through not overcooked and dry or undercooked and raw. Check with colleagues or supervisors that you apply the correct process, for example seafood is cooked long enough on one side with correct colour before bei turned. Spoon fat over the seafood during shallow frying to enhance moisture.</p>

                            <p>Most seafood has very little connective tissue and is relatively easy to cook but to get it perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp
                                outside texture requires practice. This is one of the reasons why so many people do not want to cook seafood at home as it often ends up
                                dry and overcooked.</p>

                            <p><strong>Retaining moisture</strong> – seafood can be cooked whole which retains the juices, making it moister than fillets. Fish fillets
                                are very popular
                                as customers do not want to have to remove or even swallow bones.</p>

                            <p><strong>Removing bones</strong> – the chef must consider this in the preparation and remove all the bones either by cutting out the pin
                                bones or using
                                tweezers to remove them.</p>

                    <p>Traditionally the presentation side of a fillet of fish is the bone side, since it looks cleaner than the skin side and does not have the
                        bloodline running through the middle.</p>

                    <p>For some presentation styles the skin side is used, for example in Asian dishes or Creole-style cooking. The scales need to be removed and the
                        fish is grilled or cooked on the bone side briefly to prevent curling and then finished skin side down to make it crisp and to enhance the
                        appearance.</p>

                    <p>Most seafood is cooked through but there are some expectations where the fish or shellfish should be only just cooked:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oily fish such as tuna and salmon tend to become dry once cooked through, so are often seared to a little
                                underdone.
                            </li>
                            <li>Scallops are also just seared, to keep them moist.</li>
                            <li>Shellfish such as prawns and lobster should only just be cooked to the point of doneness.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>However, you must consider your clientele and their preferences.</p>

                            <p>Fish and shellfish are very versatile and provide an excellent opportunity to display the culinary skills of the
                                chef. Cooking times vary of course depending on the size of the seafood and the type.</p>

                            <p>Most seafood is cooked through within minutes unless it is a whole large fish. Additionally the seafood can be
                                checked by using a thermometer for internal temperature or by making a small incision and inspecting the degree of
                                doneness. Most fish are well done at an internal temperature of <strong>65&#176;C</strong>.</p>

                            <p>It is important to understand the product and which cookery methods will be best suited for it and to then apply them correctly.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Cod and pan-fried scallops, and sauce – method</em></strong></p>

                    <p>Lay the cod fillets on a board. Mix the softened butter with the lemon juice and seasoning, and brush over the
                        fillets.</p>

                    <p>Preheat the oven to 190&#176;C/gas mark 5. In an ovenproof sauté pan over a medium heat, melt the butter and sweat the
                        shallot for 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and sweat for a further minute.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, bring the wine to the boil in another pan and boil for 10 seconds. Add the boiled wine, water and some
                        seasoning to the sauté pan and bring to the boil. Sit the turbot fillets on top of the mushrooms and cover with a
                        lid. Cook in the oven for five minutes</p>


                    <p>Pan fry the scallops in a little butter until golden brown on the outside and still a little raw on the inside.</p>

                    <p>Transfer the fish and scallops to a small baking tray and set aside to rest for three minutes, then put back in the
                        oven for one minute to keep warm while you finish the sauce and cook the vegetables.</p>

                    <p>While the fish is resting, add the cream to the pan, bring to the boil and whisk in the butter. It is important to
                        use cold butter, adding little pieces and whisking to create an emulsion</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Spring herbs and greens – ingredients</em></strong></p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">

                            <li>100g baby spinach</li>
                            <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>

                    <p><strong><em>Spring herbs and greens – method</em></strong></p>

                    <p>Cook the spinach for one minute, then add the cucumber and take off the heat. Check the seasoning and add a little lemon juice. Finish with the chopped herbs and diced tomato.</p>

                    <p>Place the vegetables in the middle of each warmed large serving bowl.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Cucumber ribbons – ingredients</em></strong></p>

                    </div>

                    <p><strong><em>Cucumber ribbons – method</em></strong></p>

                    <p>Peel the cucumber, then cut 12 long thin ribbons, using a mandoline or swivel vegetable peeler, turning as you go, until you are left with the seeds, which can be discarded.</p>

                    <p>Season lightly with salt and freeze on a tray for 1 hour. Rinse under cold water to defrost and remove the salt.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Garnish – ingredients</em></strong></p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">

                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong><em>Plating up</em></strong></p>

                    <p>Warm a large serving bowl. Place the vegetables in the middle of each bowl, keeping them centred as much as possible. Place three or four ribbons of cucumber, on top of the vegetables. Place the rested cod on top of the vegetables, place the scallops around the dish. Sauce the dish around the fish, garnish with microherbs and a green herb oil. Ensure that when presenting that the colours of the dish are displayed.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Lobster thermidor sauce - method</em></strong></p>

                    <p>Peel the shallots, cut them into fine dice and cook them in a little butter. Add the white wine, fish stock and the
                        parsley, and reduce by two thirds.</p>

                    <p>Add the reduction to the Mornay sauce and stir in the mustard.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Lobster thermidor - method</em></strong></p>

                    <p>Remove the claws from the lobsters, crack and remove the meat, leaving it whole. Cut the lobsters lengthways into
                        two. Remove and dispense with the gravel bag and intestines. Remove the flesh from the tails and cut it into neat
                        scallops. Clean the shells.</p>

                    <p>Cook the lobster meat in butter, mixed with a little of the sauce. Reheat the sauce, make a liaison with the egg
                        yolk and add it to the sauce and keep hot but do not reboil.</p>

                    <p>Pour a little of the sauce into the lobster shells. Add the meat, placing the claw meat into the head cavity. Coat
                        with the remaining sauce, liberally sprinkle with parmesan cheese and colour under a grill for service. Keep
                        warm.</p>
