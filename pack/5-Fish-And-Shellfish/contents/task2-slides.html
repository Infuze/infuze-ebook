                            <p>Seafood preparation requires a high skill level to avoid excessive waste. Whilst more and more pre-cut
                                products are used, the chef must know the basic preparation steps and portion cuts.</p>

                            <p>Seafood is very susceptible to contamination through poor handling during preparation so you need to
                                establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) and systems to prevent any food poisoning.</p>

                    <p>It is important to remember that spoilage is a health hazard. It can cost you money and possibly your kitchen’s reputation but it can be prevented by correct preparation, cleaning and storage. The following basic rules will help you to minimise contamination.</p>

                                    <li>Due to the susceptibility to spoilage and the relatively high cost of seafood it is important to
                                        establish a detailed analysis of the establishment’s needs and actual sales. Having a mixture of
                                        canned, frozen, fresh and live product will provide menu choice and assist in stock management.

                                    <li><strong>Canned seafood</strong> such as tuna in oil, brine or spring water, canned salmon and pickled fish have
                                        extensive storage time and can be used for many menu applications.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Fresh seafood</strong> should be delivered in temperature-controlled vehicles or at least in sealed boxes
                                        and stored on ice. Ensure that you use reputable suppliers which are preferably HACCP-accredited.

                                    <li>Develop <strong>standard operating procedures</strong> for the delivery of goods such as: delivery and order
                                        specifications; temperature and quality control checks; and storage standards (for example moving

                                    <li><strong>Frozen seafood</strong> is also an effective way to always have stock on hand which can be cooked to order
                                        or thawed out on a needs basis. With frozen seafood it is important to have a good inventory system
                                        and use ‘first in, first out’ (FIFO) to ensure that stock is used appropriately. Many products are
                                        now individually frozen and can individually be thawed out easily or even cooked from frozen,
                                        cutting down waste.

                                    <li>Use <strong>FIFO</strong> and order according to your kitchens needs. It may be better to get three deliveries a
                                        week and use the entire product than get one large delivery and lose products due to spoilage.

                    <p>Temperature-controlled coolrooms and fridges will be a major factor to ensure correct storage of seafood. It may be necessary to add plastic sheeting on the inside of your coolroom door to prevent cold air from escaping. Research shows that vertical plastic sheeting in a cool room door will cut loss of cold air by 92%.</p>

                            <p>Frozen seafood has to be stored below –18ºC and wrapped correctly to prevent any icing up and freezer burn.
                                Shatter packs with plastic sheet layers to separate fish fillets are ideal as you can thaw out the estimated
                                number of portions rather than the whole box.</p>

                            <p>Always thaw seafood out in the coolroom/fridge overnight. Never float it in water to thaw out as you can
                                contaminate the seafood and it also affects the structure of the fish flesh. Thawing it under cold running
                                water is just as bad and uses up a precious resource.</p>

                                    <li>Check temperature of frozen seafood at delivery. If the product is warmer than <strong>– 18&#176;C</strong> reject it!
                                        Place straight into the freezer.</li>
                                    <li>Use <strong>FIFO</strong> stock rotation principles.</li>
                                    <li>Frozen seafood should be stored in its <strong>original packaging</strong> – the types available are:

                                        <li>whole blocks, for example cooked or raw prawns, scallop meat</li>
                                        <li><strong>individually quick frozen (IQF)</strong>, for example prawns, whole fish</li>

                                    <li>Frozen seafood always needs to be <strong>covered</strong> to prevent freezer burn.</li>
