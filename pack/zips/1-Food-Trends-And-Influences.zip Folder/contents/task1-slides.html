                Today people think of the dining experience as part of the social society we live in.</p>
              <p>Professional kitchens have taken this on board and now develop their offering to guide customers through the

                <p>Cooking techniques have developed and changed throughout history, from Romans to modern-day national cuisines.</p>

                <p>Initially, Romans boiled or stewed their meats. However, with the advent of war and the conquests of other countries, their techniques began
                  to develop. They tended to adopt local techniques to feed their troops and people. Eventually these techniques found their way back to Rome
                  for all to enjoy.</p>

                <p>This process continued throughout the middle ages and still continues to this day, as travel has become more prevalent.</p>

            <p>Today, cooking techniques from far and wide are now influencing food preparation all over the world. These include:</p>
            <div class="page-u-list">
              <ul>
                <li>Africa – wrapping food in banana leaves and steaming</li>

              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Following the voyages by Europeans, some of these techniques were then adopted in their homelands. In turn, the techniques used in Europe
              influenced the inhabitants of countries thousands of miles apart:</p>

                <p>Menus and recipes have developed over many years and in different regions of the world. This is due in part to the availability of
                  commodities. Transportation – initially ships – allowed the sharing of commodities throughout the ‘known’ world. These included:</p>

              <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2">

                <p>The structure of a menu is influenced by many factors such as culture, commodities and the occasions.</p>

                <p>In early times the main focus of the menu was on simple foods that had been adopted from other regions, especially so in the Roman era.</p>

                <p>During the middle ages the European menu was focused on meat, with less emphasis on vegetables.</p>

                <p>During the 17th century, food menus developed with the onset of classical French cuisine. This was shared later in the 18th century as
                  French chefs migrated overseas.</p>

                <p>The 19th century saw the development of individual courses on a menu, substituting the list of food. It was at this time that signature
                  dishes began to appear.</p>

            <h1 class="page-h1">Geography</h1>

            <p>The effect of geography on the supply, type and quality of any food commodity cannot be understated. Professional chefs need to understand this
              difference.</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Soil</h3>

            <p>Soil provides nutrients for vegetables, fruits and other organic foods. If there are insufficient amounts of nutrients, the growth of the plant
              will be restricted. The type of soil can also affect the overall flavours of a food. An example of this is the different soils that grapes are
              grown in for particular tastes.</p>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Climate</h3>

            <p>The climate probably has the largest impact on food. This includes providing sunlight and warmth for growing organic food and rainfall: not
              enough rain and both plants and animals may not grow. Certain food only grows in certain areas due to the climate in that area.</p>

            <p>Communities close to a lake or river, or surrounded by the sea, tend to have an abundance of fish. Lakes and rivers also provide a source of
              water for agriculture.</p>

            <div class="media-center-hor"><img src="images/task1/image10.jpg"></div>

            <h3 class="page-h3">Terrain</h3>

            <p>Understanding the terrain and the effect it has on producing commodities is essential for producers. The terrain can best be defined as the
              ‘natural features’ of an area of land. Some commodities need good drainage, others plenty of water, more shade than sunlight etc.</p>

                <h3 class="page-h3">Health</h3>

                <p>A person’s health will directly effect their choice of food and drink. This may be due to allergic reactions to some types of food or a
                  person’s choice to eat certain foods for nutritional reasons.</p>

                <h3 class="page-h3">Cost</h3>
