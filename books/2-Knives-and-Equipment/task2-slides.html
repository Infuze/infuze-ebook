                                    <li><strong>Bat:</strong> Meat can be tenderised with the use of meat mallets or bats. These are typically made of steel
                                        or sometimes wood. The tenderising tools resemble a hammer-like handled utensil and are made with a
                                        flat or point-protruding surface that can be pounded into the meat to break apart the meat fibres.
                                        This process helps to reduce toughness in a cut of meat.

                                    <li><strong>Blender:</strong> A blender is used to emulsify, liquify or puree. Blenders typically consist of a tall
                                        glass or plastic food container with a removable lid made with a filler hole for adding ingredients
                                        during the process. At the base of the food container there are motor-driven blades that blend,
                                        chop, mix or liquefy foods, depending on the speed setting selected.

Small in size, the blow torch uses butane gas for the flame emitted from the torch. Blow torches are typically built with safety locks and holding stands so they don't need to be laid down on counters.

                                        sizes. Each can have a different effect on the outcome of your baked goods. Silicone bakeware is a
                                        fairly new product used for baking moulds. It is made of a flexible and bendable silicone material
                                        that can be used in the oven, microwave and freezer.

                                        brush is used to apply glazing to breads, pastries or cookies before or after baking. It is also
                                        commonly used to brush on barbecue sauces, olive oil, garlic oil and egg washes.

                                        on the opposite end. The small opening is the decorating end and generally has different tips that
                                        can be interchanged to create a variety of decorative shapes. Some common tips are the round tip for

                                        wide. A ram or plunger connected to the handle of the ricer is pressed down onto the food, forcing
                                        it through the small holes in the bottom.

                            <li><strong>Safe and hygienic storage:</strong> All tools should be safety stored in the correct area within the kitchen. Any
                                faults or damages to the tools or small equipment should be reported to the supervisor immediately. Never
                                use equipment that is damaged, as this could lead to injury.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Security procedures:</strong> Small tools and equipment should be secured at all time to prevent loss, theft or
                                damage. They are expensive items, and are part of the tools of the trade for any chef.

                                out your job role. It is important that you understand how to use them properly and some of the definitions
                                of the skills used.</p>

                            <p>The following set of slides will go through some of these techniques.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Basting</strong> is the process of moistening food during the cooking process, especially meat, with pan drippings,
                                butter, or sauces. This can be done by spooning the liquid over the food periodically as it cooks, or by
                                brushing it with a basting brush.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Beating</strong> is the act of mixing or stirring ingredients rapidly until they are blended. For example, egg
                                whites can be beaten with a whisk until they are light and airy and the volume has increased.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Blanching</strong> is the process of briefly cooking food in boiling water or steam and then immersing the food in
                                ice-cold water or frozen storage to stop the cooking process. Blanching brings out the colour in vegetables
                                and helps to maintain their nutritional value, which can be lost with overcooking. Blanching is also useful
                                for loosening the skins of fruits and vegetables so that the skins can be removed easily.

                                    <li><strong>Blending</strong> is the process of combining two or more ingredients together so that they lose their
                                        individual characteristics and become smooth and uniform. For example, cake batter is the result of
                                        dry and liquid ingredients that are blended together in a uniform mixture, and this can be done with
                                        electric blenders or with spoons.

                                    <li><strong>Coating</strong> is a process in which foods are pulled/put through dry ingredients, such as flour, in order
                                        to coat them before cooking. Flour can be used alone as a coating, but it is more often combined
                                        with other dry ingredients such as herbs, spices, salt or breadcrumbs to create a seasoned coating
                                        on the food that becomes brown and crispy after it is cooked. Fish fillets, boneless poultry, pork
                                        cutlets and veal cutlets are some foods that are often dredged in flour and other dry ingredients
                                        before cooking.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Cooling/chilling/refreshing</strong> are terms referring to the cooling of food, either to keep it safe or
                                        to stop the cooking process of a food item such as vegetables. Refreshing is similar to blanching,
                                        where food is briefly cooked and then immersed in ice-cold water or chilled or frozen storage to

                                result of basting food with a liquid, such as a meat stock, during the cooking process. A glaze may also
                                refer to something that gives food a more substantial coating, such as a covering of chocolate; or glazes
                                can be created to make food items more aesthetically pleasing, such as adding an egg wash to some baked

                                grating instrument. A grater is a hand-held metal device that contains numerous raised slots of varying
                                sizes that cut food items into small pieces as it is being rubbed across them. A food processor can also be
                                used to grate foods, and it may be preferred for food items that are difficult to grate on a manual grater.

                                affected by too much or too little of certain ingredients. There are various types of measuring utensils:
                                measuring cups, spoons, jugs, scales.

                            <li><strong>Portioning</strong> is the dividing up of a larger quantity into specific serving sizes or portions. It is essential
                                that food is correctly portioned so that the correct amount of customers are served from the dish/products;
                                this will also ensure that budgetary requirements are met and that you don’t over- or under-produce a dish.
                                Portioning will also ensure that the correct size of the product is achieved.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Pureeing</strong> is to blend, grind or mash food until it is a thick, smooth, lump-free consistency. Pureeing can
                                be done in a blender, food processor or food mill, or can be accomplished by pressing the food through a
                                sieve. This process is used on many types of food and the pureed food is used in many ways, such as in
                                soups, as a sauce, in desserts and in making beverages.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Reducing</strong> is to thicken and intensify the flavour of a liquid by rapidly boiling the contents in an
                                uncovered pan in order to evaporate excess liquid. This process is used generally on soups and sauces. It is
                                similar to deglazing, but is not the same. When reducing, the liquid contents are boiled in order to
                                evaporate and reduce the volume of liquid so that the remaining contents are thicker and more flavourful. If
                                a recipe suggests reducing a sauce by a half, simmer the liquid until half of the original volume is removed
                                by boiling off the lighter liquid contents.

                            <li><strong>Rolling</strong> is the process of making a larger food item thinner though applied pressure on the food
                                surface. A rolling pin is commonly used in a kitchen for this task. For example, a sweet paste after
                                it has been made and rested could be rolled out to the required thickness to line a pastry mould for
                                a pie or tartlet.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Saucing</strong> is a term for creating mixtures to be applied over various foods either as they finish
                                cooking, or for use after they are served. For example, a finishing sauce may be mixed into
                                spaghetti as a pasta sauce or served as a topping over sliced pieces of roasted meat such as roast
                                beef. Other types of finishing sauce may include red wine sauce, pepper sauce, béarnaise sauce or
                                mushroom sauce.

                            <li><strong>Searing</strong> is the process of quickly browning the surface of food by exposing it to extremely high heat. Food
                                is most often seared in a small quantity of oil and is then cooked to the appropriate doneness using another
                                cooking method such as roasting, grilling or braising. Searing can be done in a frying pan, BBQ, oven or on
                                a grill. Meat is often seared to provide a flavourful brown crust on the surface.

                            <li><strong>Serving</strong> is the process of serving food to the customer using a variety of serving trays, plates and bowls,

                            <li><strong>Skimming</strong> is the process of removing scum, fat or other impurities from the surface of a liquid, such as
                                stock or jam, while it is cooking. A slotted spoon is generally used to remove solid impurities, while an
                                unslotted spoon would be used to remove liquids such as fat.

                                a slicing mandolin.

                            <li><strong>Straining</strong> is to remove undesirable particles from a liquid, to separate liquid from other solids or to
                                separate various contents from other contents, such as removing smaller particles from larger particles.
                                When a food item is strained the contents are poured through a sieve, a perforated utensil or a fine-meshed
                                cheesecloth.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Trussing and tying</strong> is to tie meat or poultry with a string, which may be woven through the bird parts by
                                using a needle in order to create a more compact shape for the food being prepared. Typically, the wings and
                                legs of poultry are tied or trussed securely against the body to enable the bird to be evenly cooked.
                                Trussing utensils may also include skewers or pins that are used instead of string to hold the bird parts
                                together.
