                                of the kitchen. The correct tools allow a chef to show his or her skills by means of the

                                    knife used for most types of chopping, dicing and slicing. Chef's knives come in
                                    various
                                    lengths of 6, 8, 10 and 12 inches. The size, weight and balance of this knife allow

                                    to be used for heavy-duty work with thicker cuts of vegetables, fruit and meats.

                                <li><b>Paring knife:</b> This small knife has a straight, sharp blade that is generally 3 to 5
                                    inches long. Its thin, narrow blade tapers to a point at the tip. It is easy to

                                    and works well for peeling and coring foods, or mincing and cutting small items.

                                        for filleting fish. The narrow blade enables the knife to cleanly move along the backbones of the
                                        fish, in and around areas adjacent to bones, and to evenly slice along skin, removing it easily from
                                        flesh.

                                    <li><strong>Boning knife:</strong> A knife with a thin blade, typically 5 or 6 inches long, used to remove the main bone
                                        within a cut of meat such as a ham or a beef roast. A boning knife will typically have a long narrow
                                        blade for ease of manipulation around bones. The blade is rigid and proportionate to the size of the
                                        bones being removed.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Carving knife:</strong> A knife with a long slender blade, used for cutting thin slices of meat. The knife
                                        has a long blade so that it can easily cut across a large roast. The knife is available in different
                                        lengths: 10, 12 and 14 inch blades. They are designed so that the meat will cut smoothly and not be
                                        torn as it is being sliced.

                                        long. It is designed to curve upwards on both the cutting edge and the top edge. The turning knife
                                        is commonly used to turn vegetables.

                                    <li><strong>Serrated knife:</strong> A knife with a sharp edge that has saw-like notches or teeth. The blade of a
                                        serrated knife is 5 to 10 inches long. Serrated knives are difficult to sharpen. A serrated knife
                                        with a long blade is useful for slicing through food that is hard on the outside and soft on the
                                        inside, such as crusty bread.

                                    <li><strong>Sharpening tool:</strong> A tool generally made of steel, used to realign a knife's edge. Often the knife's
                                        edge will bend or roll slightly from normal use. Running it across the steel will straighten the
                                        edge, and the knife will be sharp again. A sharpening tool can also be glass, ceramic or
                                        diamond-impregnated metal.

                                    <li><strong>Peeler:</strong> A tool used to remove layers of skin/flesh from vegetables and firm fruits. Standard
                                        designs for peelers include a rigid blade that is formed into one position, so the hand is required
                                        to guide the peeling by following the shape of the item being peeled. Peelers are also available
                                        with a swivel blade to enable a more effective method of peeling.

                                    <li><strong>Corer:</strong> A round-bladed speciality tool for removing the cores and seeds of apples, pears and
                                        cucumbers. Corer blades may be v-shaped, formed into a half circle, or full-circled with scooped
                                        sides. The small-toothed or sharpened blades allow it to be easily inserted 4 to 6 inches deep into
                                        the end of an apple and rotated.

                            <li>Washing knives by hand will extend their lifetime. Knives that are washed in the dishwasher are exposed to
                                harsh detergents, which will dull the cutting edge, and to intense and varied temperatures that can affect
                                the temper of the steel. Damage is also likely to occur to the sharp edge of a knife if it is knocked around
                                by other items in a dishwasher.
                            </li>
                            <li>Knives should be wiped clean immediately after use to prevent discoloration of the blade.</li>
                            <li>When washing items in a sink of warm soapy water, do not place a knife in with other items. Doing so risks
                                injury to the person washing the knife, and it also risks damage to the blade from the other items. Do not
                                allow the knife to soak in the water; soaking will damage the blade and handle. Wash and dry it immediately.

                            <p>As a chef in a professional kitchen, it is important that you can recognise and use a variety of different
                                cuts. Many of these cuts are derived from traditional French cookery, which is why many of the terms are in
                                French.</p>

                            <p>Mastering the various cutting techniques takes practice and skill, but once mastered they will enable you to
                                use your skills confidently in the kitchen.</p>

                            <p>It is important to cut properly. The main reason is uniformity. Uniformity in cutting helps to ensure even,
                                predictable cooking times.</p>

                            <LI><strong>Boning:</strong> A knife is used to remove the main bone within a cut of meat, such as a ham or leg of lamb. Boning
                                allows for quicker cooking times, and the area from which the bone has been removed can be stuffed.

                            <LI><strong>Carving:</strong> Carving is usually associated with roasted meats and bread products. A serrated or thin-bladed
                                knife is used to slice through the body of the food. The size of the cut will determine what the product is
                                used for.

                            <LI><strong>Chopping (finely, coarsely):</strong> This technique is used in a variety of ways to reduce the size of item, ie
                                finely chopping herbs to incorporate into stuffings or curries. The blade of the knife is usually handled in
                                a downwards rocking motion to enable the blade to cut through the food.

                            <LI><strong>Coring:</strong> A round-bladed speciality tool is used to remove the cores and seeds of apples, pears and
                                cucumbers. The area from which the core has been removed can be stuffed. For instance, an apple can be

                                    <LI><strong>Macedoine</strong> is a large dice cutting technique producing medium to large cubes, 8mm x 8mm. Typically
                                        this cut would be used for vegetables in a soup or a stock base.

                                fillet cut from meat. A knife is used to move along the backbones of the fish or meat, in and around areas
                                adjacent to bones, and to evenly slice along the skin, removing it easily from the flesh.

                                the flesh. Marking and scoring is also used to make decorative patterns on the flesh which are appealing to
                                the eye.

                                certain fresh fruits and vegetables are peeled, an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase contained in the cells
                                is exposed to and reacts with the oxygen in the air, which can turn them brown.

The cutting edge is used to slice, cut or chop food items both large and small, with the middle of the blade being used most often.

The tang is riveted into the handle, or is sometimes enclosed in a plastic or metal handle. It is important to get a good feel of the handle before purchasing a knife to be sure it fits your hand properly. If it is too big or small, it can result in inefficient use.</p>

It has a smooth, blunt edge to allow the user to grip it with thumb and forefinger, or to be able to apply pressure with fingers or the palm of a hand to add control to the task being performed.</p>

                                    <p>A bolster is a thick piece of metal (collar or shank) at the end of the blade, just before the handle. It generally runs the full length from the spine of the blade down to the cutting edge. The bolster, along with the tang, gives the knife balance, which provides for better control of the knife when cutting. It also provides a place for fingers to be placed for comfort, and provides protection from the blade. The bolster is an indication that the blade was forged rather than stamped.</p>
