                            <p>Seafood is popular with customers, especially as it is often not cooked at home.</p>

                            <p>From traditional starters, such as smoked salmon and prawn salad, to more elaborate items such as lobster
                                ravioli in tomato consommé or the traditional seafood platter, there is a mouth-watering selection of

                        Seafood – nutrition
                    </h1>

                    <p>Why should we include seafood in our diet?</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Seafood is very nutritious as it has high protein content, contains all essential amino acids and is an
                                excellent source of <strong>omega-3 fatty acids</strong>. The omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated and have been shown to
                                have beneficial effects on human blood fat levels, heart disease and blood pressure.
                            </li>
                            <li>Seafood is also low in cholesterol. It is easy to digest as the protein in seafood is broken down and
                                absorbed by the body more easily than the protein in red meats and poultry. Fish contain between <strong>17%</strong> and <strong>25%</strong> protein; on average the protein content is about <strong>19%</strong>.
                            </li>
                            <li>Seafood is very low in fat (<strong>1–5%</strong> fat depending on the type). Oily fish such as salmon and trout contain
                                fats and oils within their flesh and skin, and usually have a higher fat content than most whitefish such as
                                cod, which only contain oil in their livers. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                    <li>Minerals such as <strong>calcium, zinc, iron, copper, potassium, iodine, phosphorus</strong> and <strong>selenium</strong> make
                                        seafood an important food source.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Fresh seafood is also <strong>low in sodium</strong>, however smoked and processed seafood can have high levels of
                                        salt added during processing. Seafood forms an important part of a balanced diet and many bodies
                                        recommend eating seafood at least twice a week.

                    </h1>

                    <p>Fish are sub-classified into two major groups: <strong>bony fish</strong> and <strong>cartilaginous fish</strong>. Bony fish have a skeleton and the
                        flesh is attached to the bones. Typical examples are trout and salmon.</p>

                    <p>Cartilaginous fish have no skeleton but cartilage that provides the structure of the fish. Sharks and rays are
                        examples of this type of fish. The advantage of these species is that you end up with boneless fillets.</p>

                    <p>Fish can further be classified in a number of ways depending on preference:</p>

                        Flat and round fish
                    </h1>

                    <p>Round fish are those that are symmetrical and have eyes on both sides of their heads. They have a fillet on either
                        side of their body, which are identical in size. Typical examples are trout, salmon, snapper, cod and herring.</p>

                    <p>In contrast, flat fish are generally born shaped like a round fish but one eye migrates to the other side of the
                        head and the body flattens out. Typical examples are sole, flounder and turbot.</p>

                    <p>Flat fish are usually bottom dwellers, usually burrow in the sand and have protective colouring on their skin. The
                        skin is mottled and darker on the top where the eyes are and very light on the underside. They have four fillets –
                        two on top and two underneath. The top fillets are thicker and are usually referred to as the primary fillets. The
                        fillets of the white side are thinner and are called secondary fillets.</p>

                    <p>The fillets vary in size and should be mixed for starters with one primary plus one secondary fillet per serving to
                        even out the weight.</p>

                        Shellfish sub-classification

                            <p>Shellfish are marine animals that have a protective shell or exoskeleton. They can be sub-classified into <strong>crustaceans</strong> and <strong>molluscs</strong>.</p>

                            <div class="page-u-list">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Crustaceans have an external skeleton for protection, are usually dark green to coppery in colour
                                        and live along the coastline and estuary regions.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Molluscs are invertebrates which means they possess no backbone. They are instead protected by an
                                        outer shell or are soft-bodied. One particular sub-classification of molluscs is the <strong>cephalopod</strong>.
                                        Common cephalopod species are squid, octopus and cuttlefish. They usually have a prominent head with
                                        tentacles or arms.
                                    </li>

                            </div>

                            <p>In general shellfish live in coastal and estuarine regions. However, some such as the Alaskan king crab and scallops live on continental shelves far out to sea.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Bêche de mer</strong> is also referred to as <strong>sea cucumber</strong> or <strong>trepan</strong> and is mainly used for Asian dishes.
                                        Only the roe is eaten. It varies in colour from yellow to orange. The finer the grain the better the
                                        quality. Used for sushi and in Asian dishes and sauces.

                                    <li><strong>Sea urchin</strong> is prepared using a heavy glove to protect the hand from spines. With the point of a
                                        pair of scissors cut a circle large enough to spoon out the roe meat inside. Make sure that none of
                                        the shell or the spines are included. Process as required afterwards.

                        Introduction to seafood quality points
                    </h1>

                    <p>Seafood can be purchased <strong>fresh</strong>, <strong>live</strong> or <strong>frozen</strong>. Seafood quality indicators differ for fresh, live and frozen seafood and between fish, crustaceans and molluscs. In general:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>fresh seafood</strong> quality signs are based on appearance, odour, texture and taste</li>
                            <li><strong>live seafood</strong> quality can be checked for smell, movement, bruising or injuries and relative weight to size,
                                as live seafood will lose weight as it no longer feeds
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>frozen seafood</strong> must be inspected for freezer burn and date of purchase, ‘use by’ date and appropriate
                                storage and delivery.
                            </li>

                            <p>Live seafood is preferred by many connoisseurs, and many Asian restaurants are renowned for their live seafood
                                available for direct orders by the customers. Waste can also be reduced as the fish is kept alive until ordered
                                but any faulty equipment can cause considerable costs if the seafood dies.</p>

                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> To kill live seafood humanely you need to minimise suffering. Fish from a tank should be stunned with a
                                quick blow to the head or brain spiked, then the intestine removed. Crustaceans should be placed in the freezer,
                                ice slurry or freshwater to slow body functions. Then submerge the head into boiling liquid, brain spike or cut
                                through the longitudinal mid-line to kill the seafood quickly.</p>

                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Fish processors generally will not accept shellfish from fishermen if they are missing more than one or
                                two limbs.</p>

                            <p>If green crustaceans are discoloured with dark spots, it is known as melanosis. This is due to oxidisation of
                                the crustacean and does not initially affect eating quality. However, once it has started it it will progress
                                rapidly and change the flavour of the meat.</p>

                            <p>Peel the crustacean and cook it to avoid further deterioration. It is advisable to store fresh green prawns or
                                other crustaceans in ice slurry to prevent oxygen from affecting the seafood.</p>

It is a collective name for a number of different species found in the Northern Atlantic, the Arctic and the Western Pacific oceans. An alternative to cod, you can use pollock or coley which are similar in taste and flavour. The commercial fishing of the Atlantic cod species has led to overfishing which has created problems in supply.</p>
