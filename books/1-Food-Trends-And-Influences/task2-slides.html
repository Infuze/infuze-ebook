                <p>Cooking methods have developed beyond the chef’s imagination of 20 years ago, with the introduction of pre-programmed and temperature-sensitive equipment to provide the accuracy required to produce the final dish. This type of equipment includes:</p>

            <p>
              Science and technology have had a major impact on the ability of organisations to store food for longer and provide safer food for their customers. This includes the use of:
            </p>

            <div class="page-u-list">
              <ul>
                <li>Centrally controlled and monitored refrigerated systems to delay the growth of food spoilage bacteria</li>
                <li>The use of nitrogen in packaging to remove oxygen and prevent bacterial growth</li>
                <li>Freezing food to remove the water, again deterring the growth of bacteria</li>
                <li>The canning process, heating food to 121˚C for 3 minutes to kill bacteria, known as a botulinum cook</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>In each case this allows the professional chef to store food safely for their customers and to reduce waste.</p>

            <h1 class="page-h1">Molecular gastronomy</h1>

            <p>Molecular gastronomy employs science and technology to improve the preparation and cooking of food. The term was first used in 1969 by Hungarian scientist Nicholas Kurti and French scientist Hervé
              This.</p>
            <p>Some notable practitioners include:</p>
            
            <div class="page-u-list">
              <ul>
                <li>Heston Blumenthal</li>
                <li>Pierre Gagnaire</li>
                <li>Thomas Keller</li>
                <li>Emmanuel Stroobant</li>
                <li>Ferran Adrià</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The overall aim of this type of cooking is to provide diners with unusual and original recipes. In some cases this includes the whole dining experience enhanced by the use of aerosols to add a subtle
              aroma to the air in the restaurant.</p>
            <p>Dishes created using molecular gastronomy include:</p>

            <div class="page-u-list">
              <ul>
                <li>Seared foie gras with a 24-carat golden egg</li>
                <li>Beetroot, dark chocolate, raspberry and black olives</li>
                <li>Charcoal, ashes and 64° egg</li>
                <li>Creamy kazu Parmesan gnocchi with pea water</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>In some cases, the dishes that have been developed using this method have made it to mainstream cuisine – most famously ‘triple-cooked chips’ by Heston Blumenthal.</p>
            <p>However, in the main, the development of this type of cooking is generally only seen in Michelin star restaurants across the globe.</p>
            <p>Dishes of simple origin have now been worked and developed by chefs using molecular gastronomy. An example of this is the simple shepherd’s pie. Instead of a dish that was made from lamb, potatoes, onions
              and seasoning, the new drive for a unique flavour and experience has developed recipes that contain – among other ingredients – beetroot and double cream.</p>
            <p>There has also been a drive where a dish is deconstructed and served separately. This includes the use of foams, or ‘espuma’, which is another use of molecular cuisine.</p>
