                                        pilau or pulao in different cultures. It is a process of cooking long grain
                                        rice.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Ratio of <strong>1:1.5</strong> or <strong>1:2</strong> depending on the quality and starchiness of the rice. It
                                        is a <strong>braised</strong> rice dish that uses stock or broth.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Diced onion is sautéed in butter and the rice is added off the heat and stirred
                                        through to coat all the grains to prevent them sticking together. Hot stock or
                                        broth and other flavourings (bay leaf, saffron, spices) are added. It’s then
                                        covered with foil or a lid then placed into the oven at 15&#176;C or cooked slowly

                                    <li>Pilaf is used as an accompaniment and is ideal for function service, as the
                                        absorption method reduces the amount of equipment needed.

                                    <li>It is important to wash the rice to remove excess starch but again the quality

                            <p>The <strong>first knuckle rule:</strong> Touch your finger to the surface of the rice in a pot. Then add water until it reaches the first knuckle/joint of your finger.</p>

                            <p>The rice is now brought to the boil and then turned down to a simmer. Do not stir the rice or take the lid off. After 10 minutes, remove from the heat and let it steam for another five minutes. Fork the rice through to separate the grains. This principle is also used in modern rice cookers.</p>

                            <li><strong>Asian cuisine</strong> uses steamers, woks and chopsticks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pilaf</strong> rice requires a pot, lid, small knife, cutting board and wooden spoon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risotto</strong> also requires a pot, lid, small knife, cutting board and wooden spoon; an
                                additional pot is needed for the stock.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Rice steamers</strong> such as commercial steamers are easy to use and ensure a perfect
                                product.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Chinese</strong> boiled or steamed rice only needs a pot with a lid and a fork.</li>
                            <li><strong>Condé rice</strong> requires a zester, pot and lid, wooden spoon and a whisk.</li>
                            <li>All mise en place requires bowls and containers. Cooking of rice dishes is done on
                                commercial steamers or gas ranges, wok burners and stoves or induction tops.
                            </li>
                            <li>Trays are essential for storage in fridges or the coolroom. Cover with clingfilm.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Aerating</strong> – when whipped, egg will capture and hold air bubbles, making mixtures
                                        lighter. This can be observed in meringue, pavlova, sponge and soufflé. Mousses
                                        and farces based on vegetables or meat also require aerating with eggs.

                                    <li><strong>Binding</strong> – eggs help to bind ingredients together, for example in a meatloaf or
                                        farce. Eggs also bind the ingredients in dough and batter, and provide
                                        structure for baked goods.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Setting</strong> – egg can set twice its own weight and is used in custards and quiche
                                        for this purpose. Use a ratio of 1:1 egg to liquid for a firm custard and 1:2

                            <li><strong>Coating</strong> – the stickiness of the egg helps to attach crumbs or other items to food. Egg
                                can also be used as a coating for seafood or poultry to keep the centre moist.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Enriching</strong> – egg provides extra flavour and body in sauces and desserts. Liaison is used
                                to provide the final flavour lift and smoothness in a sauce. The anglaise base used for
                                ice cream provides a lingering taste.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Emulsifying</strong> – egg yolks are used to emulsify (combine) liquids that don’t normally mix.
                                If egg is used, the oil and vinegar stay combined and sauces such as mayonnaise can be
                                made and stored.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Glazing</strong> – the egg yolk is used in sauces before browning the dish under the salamander
                                to achieve a golden colour in the finished product, for example for oysters Mornay or
                                for covering pastry (such as puff pastry fleurons) with egg wash before baking.
                            </li>

                                    <li><strong>Clarifying</strong> – egg white will hold impurities and bring them to the top of a
                                        simmering liquid. This property is used when clarifying soups and sauces.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Thickening</strong> – eggs are used to thicken sauces. The fat in egg yolk adds flavour
                                        and thickens the liquid. Liaison is the most commonly used thickening agent but
                                        egg yolks are also added to custards or pastry cream for thickening.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Garnishing</strong> – eggs are used as a garnish in many dishes. Small poached quail
                                        eggs can be used for an individual Caesar salad, veal schnitzel Holstein-style
                                        requires a fried egg on top. Eggs can even be used as a base for creating

                    <p>Special care must be taken particularly when cooking large amounts of food for bulk production or for special client groups. When cooking with fresh eggs the following key points should be considered:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Storage</strong> – store in a cool and dry place away from strong-smelling items; coolroom is
                                preferable but ensure that they are separate from raw meat; store in original
                                containers; apply FIFO procedures.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Preparation</strong> – do not use any cracked eggs; crack eggs into a small container first in
                                case of contamination or ‘off’ odours; use product within 30 minutes at room
                                temperature; do not use any egg shell; avoid cross-contamination.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Service of cooked/prepared product</strong> – serve product as soon as possible raw or partially
                                cooked eggs may form a health risk, particularly to high risk groups. Store egg products
                                away from strong-smelling items.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Be aware of high risk customers</strong> – elderly; sick people; pregnant women; small children
                                and babies.
                            </li>

                    <p>Often recipes call for the eggs to be separated into whites and yolks:</p>

                    <div class="page-2col">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2;">

                            <div class="page-u-list">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Emulsion sauces, anglaise and sabayon will use yolks.</li>
                                    <li>Meringue will use just the whites.</li>
                                    <li>Some recipes will use varying amounts of both yolks and whites such as sponge
                                        fingers and iced orange parfait.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>When using up leftover egg whites go by the weight called for by your recipes.
                                        If the recipe asks for the whites of four eggs you would need to calculate the
                                        amount of white produced by each egg. Since the weight percentages of an egg
                                        are egg white (60%) and egg yolk (30%), then a 60g egg would be ~36g egg white
                                        and ~18g yolk. You would require 4 x 36g = 144g egg white.

                                        centre. Place vinegar in the water in the ratio 1:10 to aid the coagulation
                                        process and put the egg in carefully. Use a sauce boat or tea/coffee cup for
                                        control.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If preparing poached eggs for functions, refresh in iced water and then reheat
                                        in salted water (this will prevent a vinegary taste). Do not use too much
                                        vinegar as it affects the taste. Egg poachers are also used in commercial
                                        kitchens for bulk production.

                                    <li><strong>Fried eggs</strong> need careful heat control to prevent a hard, leathery bottom forming
                                        and to avoid overcooking. Fresh eggs are necessary for frying so that the thick
                                        albumen holds the egg together and reduces spreading. Egg rings can be used.
                                        Fried eggs ‘sunny side up’ show the egg yolk; ‘over easy’ means they have been
                                        flipped.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Scrambled eggs</strong> can be cooked in a pan or the microwave. The eggs are whisked
                                        through with a fork, a bit of cream can be added, then finish quickly in a
                                        non-stick pan or the microwave.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Omelettes</strong> should have no or only light colour, no wrinkles and a soft, slightly
                                        runny centre (known as ‘baveuse’). This perfect finish requires practice. They
                                        are commonly rolled into a cigar shape but Spanish omelettes are flat.

                                        vegetables and soy sauce, or in Scotch eggs.

                                    <li><strong>Grilled eggs</strong> can be done on a flat grill like fried eggs. Frittata is an egg
                                        mixture that is cooked in a pan under a salamander. Crème brûlée is a classical
                                        dessert.

                                    <li><strong>Baked eggs en cocotte</strong> uses buttered ramekin dishes. The egg is cracked into the
                                        dish and then finished in a medium oven (a bain-marie can be used). <strong>Meringue</strong> is
                                        also <strong>baked</strong> in the oven, either without colour for shells or slightly browned for
                                        lemon meringue pie. Baked custards and puddings are old favourites and a soufflé
                                        is always impressive.

                    <p>The humble egg dish requires good skill level by the chef. It is cooked fairly quickly but can be cooked incorrectly being either too raw or too  hard and leathery:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Peel boiled eggs</strong> by cracking the shell all over and then carefully removing the shell.
                                Doing this with the egg under water works well.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Shaping a poached egg</strong> can be done by whisking the water into a whirlpool before adding
                                the egg as it closes the egg white around the yolk. Once poached trim off any loose
                                white.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Portion size for fried eggs</strong> is two eggs per serve. Either a two-egg or three-egg
                                omelette is made depending on customer preferences.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Moulds</strong> are used for custards or crème caramel. Cook carefully to avoid air bubbles.
                                Ensure you remove the product carefully for a smooth outside appearance.
                            </li>
                            <li>Popular sauces for egg dishes are vanilla sauce for sweet dishes and tomato sauce or
                                condiments, for example Worcestershire sauce, for savoury dishes.
                            </li>
