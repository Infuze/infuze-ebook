                        Techniques to produce cold food products

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coating:</strong> There are certain items that may need to be coated to add texture and flavour to the finished product. The coatings should complement the different flavours and textures that they are covering. Coatings may include breadcrumbs or glazes. For example, cold BBQ chicken pieces or breadcrumbed herb chicken or prawns for a buffet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combining:</strong> This is used a lot when producing cold food products, especially when making compound salads where different ingredients are combined or bound together to form one product. For example the raw ingredients of a coleslaw (carrots, onion and cabbage) are combined with a dressing or mayonnaise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cooking (boiling, poaching, steaming, baking, roasting, grilling, deep/shallow frying, stewing, braising):</strong> The majority of cold food products will have to be prepared, cooked and cooled in some manner. For example, homemade sausage rolls could be cooked, cooled and served for a buffet.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> The majority of cold food products will have to be prepared and cooked and cooled in some manner, unless they are entirely raw products such as a French salad. It is important that these are correctly cooked and cooled to maintain food safety; usually to between 3ºC and 8ºC within 90 minutes, to minimise bacterial growth. This can be achieved through the use of a blast chillier. For example, a joint of beef could be cooked, cooled and sliced for a meat platter for a buffet.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> The majority of cold food products need to be prepared by cutting in some form, using knives and small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. For example, shredding cabbage for a coleslaw.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Drying:</strong> This could be used in a variety of cold dishes using dehydrating foods as garnishes; for example, dried dehydrated apples could add texture to a Waldorf salad. Another and more simple drying technique could be drying lettuce before use in a salad. If the lettuce is added to a salad with excess water, it could change the texture and flavour of the overall dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Folding:</strong> Similar to combining, folding in is the gentle mixture of ingredients together. Alternatively, folding could refer to the folding of a ingredient; for example, when making sausage rolls you would fold the pastry over the sausage roll before baking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grating:</strong> Grating is used for a variety of cold food commodities to reduce them in size. It is usually used for commodities that are hard in texture, such as cheese or carrots. For example, a block of cheese could be grated to make a simple cheese sandwich, or carrots grated for a coleslaw.</li>

                            <li><strong>Measuring:</strong> It is important to always measure ingredients especially when mixing liquids together; for example, producing a vinaigrette for a salad. You need to measure out the correct ratios of oil and vinegar to ensure the product is of the correct consistency and flavour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Similar to combining, this refers to the mixing of ingredients together to form another product or dish. For example, mixing mayonnaise with grated eggs to produce egg mayonnaise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> One of the key techniques when producing cold food products. It is essential that food is correctly portioned to ensure that the right amount of customers are served from the dish/products; this will also ensure that budgetary requirements are met, and that you don’t over- or under-produce a dish. Portioning will also ensure that the correct size of the product is achieved; for example, cutting a cooked and cooled quiche into smaller individual portions to be served on a buffet.</li>

                            <li><strong>Storage and temperature control:</strong> These are very important when handling, storing and serving cold food products. Many cold products require correct temperature storage between 3&#176;C and 8&#176;C to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. This can be achieved through the use of cold storage display units or fridges.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">A lot of cold foods, especially cooked and cooled meat, fish and diary products, can be deemed high-risk, as they do not require any further processing or cooking and contain large amounts of proteins which are favourable to for bacteria growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weighing:</strong> It is essential to weigh out ingredients correctly to the recipe specification. This will help to achieve the correct balance of flavours and textures when preparing cold foods. For example, weighing out the portion size for individual plated Caesar salads, or weighing out the ingredients for a cooked egg and bacon quiche.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Cold fish and shellfish:</strong> Seafood such as salmon or tuna fillets can be poached, grilled or roasted with seasoning and then cooled and flaked into a salad, or mixed with a light lemon mayonnaise for a sandwich filling. Cooked prawns could be combined with a cocktail sauce and used in a simple prawn cocktail, or as a sandwich filling served with a wedge of lemon.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Decorating:</strong> Decorating is a finishing technique usually associated with cold desserts or sweet pastry. It can involve piping, small decorations such as spun sugar, or chocolate runouts. You can also decorate cold savoury items – for example, a whole poached salmon for a buffet, which can be decorated with flavoured butters and sliced cucumber.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing cold products, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing cold products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish. For example, individual prawn cocktails could be garnished with a slice of lemon and a sprig of dill; or a simple compound salad such as coleslaw could be garnished with chopped parsley. </li>

                                    <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> One of the key techniques when producing cold food products. It is essential that food is correctly portioned to ensure that the correct amount of customers are served from the dish. This will also ensure that budgetary requirements are met, and that you don’t over- or under-produce a dish. Portioning will also ensure that the correct size of the product is achieved; for example, cutting a cooked and cooled quiche into smaller individual portions to be served on a buffet.</li>
