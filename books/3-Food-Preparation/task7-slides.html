                            <p>Poaching is a process of cooking foods such as eggs, fish or meat in a liquid that has been heated to just below the boiling point, so the liquid is barely moving while the food is being cooked.</p>
                            <p>A small amount of liquid is added to a pan containing the food so that the food being poached is fully covered with the liquid, but not much more than a slight covering.</p>
                            <p>In addition, the food being poached infuses the liquid with flavour, so that it can then be used to make other dishes and sauces.</p>

                            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Poaching is one of the most popular methods for cooking healthy eggs. It's quick and easy and results in an egg that is tender, delicious and low in fat.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Unlike a boiled egg, in which the best results occur when using an older egg, a poached egg is best when a fresh egg is used. This is because when a fresh egg is placed into the heated water, it will not spread out as readily as an older egg, resulting in a cooked egg with a more even shape and texture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> Poaching is a healthy method of cooking poultry because no fat is added. It retains the poultry's flavour, tenderness and moisture through a gentle simmering process. Poaching is an especially good method to use when cooking chicken breast for a healthily diet.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Poached chicken can be eaten as part of a main meal or used as an ingredient for salads, sandwiches and other dishes. The liquid in which the chicken is poached can also be used for sauces.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Poaching is a popular method of cooking fish to ensure it remains moist without the addition of fat. The fish can be poached in a fish stock or court bouillon (which is a type of fish stock prepared with various vegetables including onions, carrots and celery, some wine or lemon juice, which all add flavour to the poaching liquid). The amount of poaching time needed will depend on the thickness of the fish fillet.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Poaching fruit such as pears, plums, peaches and rhubarb slowly in stocks or syrups such as red wine, fruit (orange etc) or spice (cinnamon, cloves) adds colour, flavour and texture to the dish. The liquid in which the fruit is poached can also be used for hot or cold syrups and sauces.</li>

                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are poached, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example is skinning fish before poaching in a fish stock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Folding:</strong> Some foods should be folded before poaching; for example, when poaching fillets of a flat fish, you would typically fold the fillets over and then poach in a fish stock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> It is essential that food is correctly portioned to ensure that the right amount of customers are served from the dish; this will also ensure that budgetary requirements are met and that you don’t over- or under-produce a dish.</li>

The poaching liquid will add flavour and texture to the food being poached. Fresh poaching liquid can be used, or convenience products. Suitable poaching liquids/liquor may include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>water</li>

                            <li><strong>Covering:</strong> Some dishes may require the food item to be covered lightly, such as when poaching fish. Covering with a lightly buttered parchment or greaseproof paper will form a ‘ceiling’ and help to keep in the moisture and prevent the top of the food item from drying out. This will ensure that the finished poached food item is moist throughout.</li>
                            <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining the water from poached eggs, vegetables or fish. If the excess liquid it is not removed it can make the final product soggy in texture, or the product may still continue to cook in the excess water. Draining can be achieved using a slotted spoon, colander or sieve. Poached food products should always be drained prior to service.</li>

                            <li><strong>Refreshing:</strong> After being removed from the poaching liquid, blanched/poached food can be plunged into a cold water bath (ice can be used; this is known as ‘shocking’) in order to stop any further cooking. Blanching helps to maintain some of the water-soluble vitamins that can be lost during the poaching process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Blanched poached foods such as eggs or asparagus may need to be refreshed/reheated in poaching liquid prior to service. This can ensure good portion control is maintained, as the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.</li>
                            <li>Reheated poached products should reach a minimum core temperature of 75&#176;C.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Skimming:</strong> The process of removing unwanted excess fluid, scum, fats, particles and food from the surface of a liquid, using a spoon with small holes or a fine mesh for draining but not releasing the skimmed items. This can be used when poaching items such as eggs or fish.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> It is very important at all stages of handling, preparation and cooking of foods for poaching that the temperature of the foods is monitored to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. Prior to cooking, all high-risk foods for poaching should be stored in the correct cold refrigeration at a temperature of between 3&#176;C and 8&#176;C until required.</li>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to the recipe cooking time. As with boiling, over-poaching will lead to a product that is squidgy or soft in texture, and can affect the overall flavour of the finished product. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked. Submerging the product so that it is only just covered during the cooking process will ensure that all parts remain moist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sufficient liquid:</strong> It is important when poaching food that there is sufficient water for the food to be fully covered, but only just. There should not be too much liquid compared to the size of the product being poached. Overfilling the pan will mean that it takes too long for the water and product to heat up to the correct temperature.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Temperature and movement of the liquid:</strong> When poaching food products, the water or liquid should be at the correct temperature, which is around 85-90ºC (just boiling point). The liquid should be brought up to boiling point (100&#176;C) and then reduced. It is important not to fully boil the liquid when poaching, as this could break up the food item.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of poached products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily, especially with fish, poultry and vegetables, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily from the product, it would suggest it is done.</li>

                            <li><strong>Correcting consistency:</strong> The finished poached product should have the correct consistency. It should be well drained, and any excess water removed. If the poaching liquid/liquor is going to be used as part of the dish, it may have to be reduced and thicken. Ensure the consistency of any sauce used in the final poached dish is correct and that it is not too thick or thin; if too thick, it may have to be thinned with a little of the poaching liquid, stock or water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Correcting seasoning:</strong> Seasoning is key to the overall taste of the finished product, so always check your seasoning throughout the poaching process.

                                    <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing poached foods as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing poached products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Glazing:</strong> Similar to reducing, glazing is the process of adding a flavourful coating to food as it is cooked. This would normally happen after the food has been poached and drained. A glaze or sauce is applied, and then finished under a grill or hot oven to give colour and texture. For example, a poached fillet of fish could be coated with a liaison-style sauce and then placed under a hot grill for a few minutes to add colour and a crispy texture to the top of the sauce.</li>

                            <li><strong>Reducing:</strong> You may need to reduce the poaching liquid/liquor after a item has been poached. Reducing is the process of thickening and intensifying the flavour of a liquid by rapidly boiling the contents in an uncovered pan so that the excess liquid evaporates. The process is similar to deglazing, but is not the same.</li>
                            <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing poached food products. Poached foods often require additional sauces to improve their appearance and add flavour and texture.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is important that a suitable and correct sauce is used when saucing poached products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing. For example, poached Dover Sole can be sauced with a simple butter sauce.</li>
