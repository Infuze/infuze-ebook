                            <p>Deep frying is the process of ‘dry’ cooking food totally covered in hot cooking fat or oil. This process produces evenly cooked food with a golden, crisp surface on the outside. While the moisture on the inside of the food, which acts to repel the oil, is heated and boils, the food steam-cooks, making it moist and tender.</p>

                            <p>The temperature of the oil is important in order to achieve the best results. The best temperature for the oil is 170ºC to 190ºC, depending on the temperature of the food being fried and the amount being cooked. Some of the foods commonly cooked by deep frying include fish, shellfish, vegetables, meat, poultry and pastries such as doughnuts.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Deep fried fish is a popular staple of the UK diet, and is a great takeaway. This can include deep fried cod, haddock, pollock and a variety of locally caught varieties of fish. Fish is often covered with flour and seasoning or some type of batter before deep frying, which provides a crispy, brown crust on the food. Great served with chipped potatoes.

                                    <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> The most common vegetable to be deep fried is the humble potato, which is cut, blanched and deep fried to make chips. Other vegetables such as cauliflower or courgettes are usually portioned, blanched and coated in a batter or breadcrumb, then deep fried. For example, deep fried cauliflower in breadcrumbs with a spicy tomato sauce.

                            <li style="list-style: none">The blanching procedure involves placing small quantities of food into a large amount of rapidly boiling water for the amount of time specified in the recipe. This method can be useful when preparing vegetables for deep frying in batter or breadcrumbs. It allows the centre of the item to be thoroughly cooked whilst keeping the outside crisp.</li>

                            <li><strong>Coating (battered, crumbed) / Even coating:</strong> Coating is a process in which foods are pulled through, or tossed in, dry or wet ingredients such as flour, egg wash, seasoned breadcrumbs, batter, etc, in order to coat them before cooking. Flour can be used alone as a coating, but it is more often combined with other ingredients such as water, beer, herbs, spices, salt, or breadcrumbs to create a seasoned coating on the food that becomes brown and crispy after it is deep fried. Fish fillets, boneless poultry and pork cubes are some of the foods that are often coated in batter or breadcrumbs before frying.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">There are a few reasons for coating; the coating applied to the food acts as a barrier that keeps the food moist as it cooks; it enables the exterior of the food to become crisp and darken evenly without burning; and it prevents the texture of the food from becoming tough.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Before coating, the food should first be lightly dried by patting with paper towels, or left to drain to minimise excess moisture.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are fried, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example might be skinning and cutting a fish fillet into portions before dipping it in batter and deep frying.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining the excess cooking oil after frying chipped potatoes. When deep frying this would usually be done with a frying basket.</li>

                            <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Before deep frying, items should first be lightly dried by patting the food item with paper towels to absorb excess moisture. This will avoid any moisture spitting with the hot oil. After frying, the food should again be lightly dried by patting with paper towels, or left to drain so that the towels absorb excess oil from the frying process. This will help to improve the flavour, appearance and texture of the finished dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> It is not ideal to reheat deep fried food, as its texture is affected; as a rule, it should be cooked and served immediately. However, some deep fried dishes such as southern fried chicken may be suitable for reheating, and this can be done in a oven prior to service. This will ensure good portion control is maintained, since the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Immersion (with/without frying basket):</strong> It is important when deep frying that the product is fully immersed in the oil. If the item is only half submerged, then the bottom will cook and the top won’t. To ensure that the item is fully immersed, don’t overfill the deep fat fryer to try and cook too many products at the same time. Remember to regularly turn the item in the hot oil.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to deep frying. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked. Deep fried items can colour very quickly so it is important that frying process is monitored throughout.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of deep fried products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily especially with meats, vegetables and fish by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily or clean from the product it would suggest it is done.</li>

                            <li><strong>Condition of oil/fat:</strong> It is important that the quality of the oil is monitored. Using old or used oils and fats can affect the cooking process and the oil won’t be as effective as it could be because flavours will have leached out during the frying process. Used old oils and fats may taint the flavour of the food. Always try to use fresh oils and fats when deep frying.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">If you do re-use oil or fat, it should be strained before re-use to remove unwanted food debris.</li>

                            <li><strong>Temperature of oil/fat:</strong> It is important that the temperature of the oil/fat is correct when deep frying.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Deep frying usually starts off with a high heat to form a crispy/firm outer layer, which provides colour and texture and reduces the amount of the frying oils/fat soaking into the food during the cooking process. If this outer layer isn’t formed because the oil is too cold, the food will absorb the fats/oils it is cooked in.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">If the temperature of the oil/fats is too hot, then it will cook the outside of the food and leave the inside of the food uncooked. This can also lead to over-colouring of the food item.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is also important that the temperature of the oil is monitored through the cooking process to minimise the risk of fire. Oil and fat has a flashpoint, which means that if the oil temperature rises above a certain temperature then there is a chance that it may ignite and cause a fire.</li>

                            <li><strong>Applying seasoning/flavours:</strong> Adding additional flavours and seasoning is common when shallow and deep frying, as flavours can be lost/absorbed in the oil during the frying process. Adding flavours after the food has been removed from the hot oil is common; for example, you can apply seasoning to potato wedges.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coating:</strong> Deep fried items such as pastries may have a coating applied once cooked. This can be a simple glazed or flavoured sugar to add flavour, texture and enhance the appearance of the food.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing deep fried foods, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing deep fried products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish. For example, deep-fried fish in a beer batter could be garnished with a slice of lemon and a sprig of parsley.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing deep fried food products because it is very difficult to incorporate sauces or cooking liquid into a dish while deep frying. Like garnishing, saucing adds flavour and texture, and it enhances the appearance of the overall dish. For example, deep fried pork balls could be served with a sweet and sour sauce.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">It is important that a suitable and correct sauce is used when saucing deep fried products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing.</li>

                            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Fried eggs and omelettes are the most common egg dishes produced using the shallow frying method. Fried eggs are cooked until the whites are firm and the yolk is runny or firm, depending on the customer’s preference. There are several methods used to finish cooking the eggs. They can be left unturned and be basted with the hot fat, or they can be finished by carefully turning them over using a spatula once they have firmed up on the bottom.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Pan frying or shallow frying is a simple task to undertake and takes relatively little time, depending on the thickness of the fish fillets being fried and on whether it is breaded or plain. Shallow frying fish adds colour and texture. It is important when pan frying fish that it is placed into the hot pan service side/skin side first. When shallow frying fish with the skin on, make sure the pan is sufficiently hot to crisp the skin.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Caramelising fruit such as apples or pears on the stove top in a frying pan is an easy technique, and helps to add taste and texture to a dish. Fruit cooked in this way makes a good accompaniment for pork or chicken, or it can be served as a simple dessert. Fried bananas also make a great dessert when served with a toffee sauce.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Meats:</strong> A variety of different meats can be cooked using the shallow frying method, from lamb chops to beef steaks to breaded veal escalopes. High heat is used to sear the meat, creating a flavourful browned crust using the Maillard reaction. The oil should sizzle when the meat hits the pan: if it doesn't sizzle, the pan and oil are not hot enough. The goal is to produce meat that has a brown, crispy surface but is tender, juicy, and flavourful inside.</li>

                            <li><strong>Mixed ingredients for batter-based products:</strong> Pan frying can be used to produce pastry items such as crêpes or drop scones. It is important that when cooking pastry items you don’t use too much oil, as this could soak into the items and affect the taste and texture. You must also take care with the temperature of the pan and ensure it is monitored throughout the cooking process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> A non-stick wok works well for cooking noodles very quickly. Many types of Asian noodles are used in stir fry dishes. Some Italian-style noodles such as spaghetti, vermicelli and linguine can be used as substitutions for Asian wheat or egg noodles when stir frying. Generally the noodles used for stir frying have to be pre-soaked or boiled before they can be used. Stir frying or frying noodles will absorb the flavour of any sauce used in cooking them.</li>

                            <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> Most types of poultry can be shallow fried. You can shallow pan-fry breast meat, sauté cuts of chicken, or use poultry in stir frying. It is a easy method of providing colour and texture to poultry dishes.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">High heat is usually used to sear the poultry pieces in order to brown the surface and seal in the natural juices. This is followed by a longer cooking period over a lower heat (medium to medium-high, depending on the thickness of the meat) in order to cook the poultry to the proper doneness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> When using previously cooked rice for a fried rice recipe, you must first cook the rice fully. The rice is stir-fried for several minutes using a small amount of oil in a large pan. No additional water or liquid is required to complete the cooking process, because the rice has already been pre-cooked in liquid. Frying previously cooked rice is quick, and it is also an excellent way of using up leftover rice.</li>

                            <li><strong>Batting:</strong> Some items, such as meat or poultry, may need to be batted out to reduce their thickness in order to encourage even, quick cooking. This process also helps to reduce the toughness of meat fibres in a cut of meat or poultry by tenderising the meat. Tenderising breaks down the fibres and softens the meat, making it easier to chew and more palatable.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Meat can also be batted out with the use of meat mallets or meat utensils, typically made of steel or similar alloys. The tenderising tools are hammer-like handled utensils, made with a flat or point-protruding surface that can be pounded into the meat to break apart the meat fibres. The meat items can be put between two pieces of clingfilm or parchment paper and batted out to reduce the damage to the surface of the meat. Items that are typically batted out include chicken breasts for escalopes or veal steaks for schnitzel.</li>

                            <li><strong>Coating:</strong> Coating is a process in which foods are pulled through, or tossed in, dry or wet ingredients such as flour, egg wash, seasoned breadcrumbs, batter, etc, in order to coat them before cooking. Flour can be used alone as a coating, but it is more often combined with other ingredients such as water, beer, herbs, spices, salt, or breadcrumbs to create a seasoned coating on the food that becomes brown and crispy after it is fried. Fish fillets, boneless poultry, pork cutlets or veal cutlets are some foods that are typically coated in batter or breadcrumbs before frying.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">There are a few reasons for coating; the coating applied to the food acts as a barrier that keeps the food moist as it cooks; it enables the exterior of the food to become crisp and darken evenly without burning; and it prevents the texture of the food from becoming tough.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Before coating, the food should first be lightly dried by patting with paper towels, or left to drain to minimise excess moisture.</li>

                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are fried, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example might be cutting a chicken into portions before sautéing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Marinating:</strong> Marinating is the process of soaking food in a seasoned liquid for the purpose of flavouring and tenderising it before cooking. Meat is often marinated in preparation for shallow frying; for example, as part of the prep for making a stir-fry the meat might be placed in an oil, garlic, ginger and soy marinade. Meat can be soaked in a marinade for anywhere from two to twelve hours (even more in some circumstances) and the marinade should totally cover the meat in order for it to work effectively. It is important to store marinating meat in the refrigerator to minimise the growth of bacteria.</li>

                            <li><strong>Basting</strong> is the process of moistening food (especially meat) during shallow frying, typically using butter or sauces. This can be done by spooning the liquid over the food periodically as it cooks, or by brushing it on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining the excess cooking oil after frying eggs. When shallow frying, this would usually be done with a slice or slotted spoon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Before shallow frying, items should first be lightly dried by patting the food item with paper towels to absorb excess moisture. This will avoid any moisture spitting with the hot oil. After frying, the food should again be lightly dried by patting with paper towels, or left to drain so that the towels absorb excess oil from the frying process. This will help to improve the flavour, appearance and texture of the finished dish.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Some shallow fried dishes such as pan fried chicken may be suitable for reheating, and this can be done in a oven or on top of a stove prior to service. This will ensure good portion control is maintained, since the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sautéing</strong> is the French word used to describe a method for cooking food in a shallow pan using high heat. The food is cooked in the pan uncovered, in a small quantity of butter or oil; a typical example is chicken chasseur. Unlike stir frying, where the food is continuously turned, when sautéed the food is turned only once in the pan in order to cook all sides.</li>

                            <li><strong>Stir frying:</strong> The process of stir frying, like sautéing, is a dry heat cooking method that quickly cooks food in a small amount of oil using high heat. Stir frying generally involves a number of ingredients being cooked together; for example, meat, vegetables and noodles might be included in a beef stir-fry.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">In order to maintain texture and flavour, the different elements of a stir fry are added to the cooking pan at different points according to how quickly the foods cook. Larger items (usually meat) are cooked first. Stir frying is a fast-paced cooking method, so it is important that everything is ready before beginning the process.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">When stir frying it is common to use a wok, which has deep tapered sides that make it easy to stir and toss the ingredients as they are cooking.</li>

                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> It is very important at all stages of handling, preparation and cooking of foods for shallow frying that the temperature of the foods is monitored to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. Prior to cooking, all foods for shallow frying should be stored in the correct cold refrigeration at a temperature of between 3ºC and 8ºC until required. All food should be thoroughly heated and kept out of the temperature danger zone.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">During the cooking process it is important to control the heat to ensure even cooking and colouring of the product.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tossing and turning:</strong> When shallow frying food it is important to regularly toss or turn the items to ensure even colouring and cooking and avoid over-browning. This can be done through movement of the pan, or by using a slice or tongs to turn the items.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to shallow frying. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of shallow fried products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily especially with meats, vegetables and fish by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily or clean from the product it would suggest it is done.</li>

                            <li><strong>Condition of oil/fat:</strong> It is important that the quality of the oil is monitored. Using old or used oils and fats can affect the cooking process and the oil won’t be as effective as it could be because flavours will have leached out during the frying process. Used old oils and fats may taint the flavour of the food. Always try to use fresh oils and fats when deep frying.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">If you do re-use oil or fat, it should be strained before re-use to remove unwanted food debris.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quantity of oil/fat:</strong> Using too much oil when shallow frying can add additional fat to the dish and make it greasy in appearance, texture and flavour. Using too little fat may lead to the fried product sticking to the frying pan.</li>

                            <li><strong>Temperature of oil/fat:</strong> It is important that the temperature of the oil/fat is correct when shallow frying.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Shallow frying usually starts off with a high heat to form a crispy/firm outer layer, which provides colour and texture and reduces the amount of the frying oils/fat soaking into the food during the cooking process. If this outer layer isn’t formed because the oil is too cold, the food will absorb the fats/oils it is cooked in.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">If the temperature of the oil/fats is too hot, then it will cook the outside of the food and leave the inside of the food uncooked. This can also lead to over-colouring of the food item.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is also important that the temperature of the oil is monitored through the cooking process to minimise the risk of fire. Oil and fat has a flashpoint, which means that if the oil temperature rises above a certain temperature then there is a chance that it may ignite and cause a fire.</li>

                            <li><strong>Applying seasoning/flavours:</strong> Adding additional flavours and seasoning is common when shallow and deep frying, as flavours can be lost/absorbed in the oil during the frying process. Adding flavours at the later stages of cooking can also prevent items for burning. For instance, adding a sticky BBQ sauce by basting the item towards the end will stop it from burning .</li>
                            <li><strong>Filling:</strong> This can be used in a variety of different ways, but is most commonly used when finishing dough-based or batter-based pastry items, such as crêpes filled with fruits of the forest.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing shallow fried foods, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing shallow fried products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish. For example, a stir-fry could be garnished with sliced spring onions and chopped coriander, and shallow fried fish could be garnished with a slice of lemon and a sprig of parsley.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing shallow fried dishes. Like garnishing, saucing adds flavour and texture, and it enhances the appearance of the overall dish. For example, pan fried fish could be served with a butter sauce such as hollandaise.</li>

Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing.</li>
