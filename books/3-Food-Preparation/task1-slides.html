                            <p>Baking is the process of applying dry heat in an enclosed space to cook food. The key to achieving correct
                                baking techniques comes down to the proper ratio between the oven temperature and the baking time, which can
                                be determined by the size or weight of the dish being cooked.</p>

                            <p>There are two main types of ovens used for baking in a professional kitchen: conventional ovens and
                                convection ovens. The type of oven used will determine how a product is baked.</p>

                            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs can be simply baked in ceramic moulds with additional flavours such as herbs and spices, spinach
                                and tomato. They are a popular choice in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine for breakfast or a light
                                snack.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Eggs mixed and combined with other ingredients can be baked in quiches.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Baking is a common method of cooking whole fish. Fish is prepared, then additional flavours, rubs and
                                ingredients (ie sliced lemon or fresh herbs) are added to the fish and the whole thing is usually wrapped up
                                in a parcel of parchment paper, tinfoil or banana leaves to seal in the flavours. These flavours will infuse
                                the food as it cooks. An example might be baking a whole red snapper with lemongrass, spices and curry
                                leaves wrapped in banana leaves. As the dish bakes the fish steams and retains the flavours and moisture.
                                The parcel can then be removed for the last few minutes of baking to let the fish colour.

                                        fruits, spices and sugar before baking in the oven. During the baking process, the apple flesh cooks
                                        and the apple skin becomes crispy.

                                    <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Baked pasta dishes have become very popular and are served as main courses, side dishes, or
                                        as the first course of a meal. They are convenient, as they can be prepared beforehand and then
                                        popped into the oven ready for service. There are many different baked pasta dishes – for example
                                        lasagne, macaroni and cheese and filled pasta. Baking is just a means of thoroughly heating all of
                                        the ingredients as one dish.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Baked pasta dishes include ingredients such as pasta, meat, fish, cheese, vegetables, herbs, spices
                                        and some type of sauce. The sauce must include enough liquid to provide sufficient moisture to keep
                                        the pasta dish from drying out. During the baking process, the pasta will be further cooked and will
                                        absorb some of the liquid from the sauce.

Oven-baked vegetables provide an enjoyable side dish for meats, poultry or any type of vegetarian menu, and can include dishes such as a simple baked potato, onions or carrots.

                                should be no sign of mould or decay or bad aroma, as this would indicate that the product is past its best.
                                If this is the case, the items should be removed, other items should be checked and the supervisor should be
                                informed.

                            <li><strong>Size and shape:</strong> The product should be the correct size and shape; it is important that when selecting and

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coating:</strong> Coating is a process in which foods are pulled through or tossed in dry or wet ingredients such as
                                flour, egg wash, seasoned breadcrumbs, sugar glaze, etc, in order to coat them before cooking. Coating helps
                                food to develop good colour and crispness as it bakes. For example, fish fillets, whole baked fish or
                                boneless poultry are some foods that are often coated.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">There are a few reasons for coating; the coating applied to the food acts as a barrier that keeps the food
                                moist as it bakes; it enables the exterior of the food to become crisp and darken evenly without burning;
                                and it prevents the texture of the food from becoming tough.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are baked, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting
                                equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting,
                                jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example might be
                                filleting a fish off the bone before topping with a crust and baking.

                                    <li><strong>Egg washing</strong> is the process of applying beaten egg to a food item before and during the baking
                                        process; for example, egg washing a savoury pie top.

                                    <li><strong>Greasing</strong> is the process of adding grease in the form of oil or fat to stop a product from sticking
                                        to the pan or tray when baked.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">This is important when prepared items have a low fat content, as the fat contained within the dish
                                        won’t leach out and it will be prone to sticking to the baking tray. Items that have a high fat
                                        content tend to stick less and will require less greasing.

                                        foods do not stick to baking sheets, pie tins, muffin tins, baking dishes, and other surfaces after
                                        baking.

                                    <li><strong>Marking</strong> is the process of adding lines/marks to a baked dish before baking. You could mark a large
                                        pie by gently scoring the top with a knife or a pastry wheel before baking.

                            <li><strong>Measuring:</strong> Proper measuring of ingredients is important to successful baking. Some foods can be greatly
                                affected by too much or too little of certain ingredients. There are several different types of measuring
                                utensils including cups, spoons, jugs and scales.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mixing/kneading</strong>: Kneading is especially important when preparing baked breads and pastries because it helps
                                to distribute the activated yeast and other ingredients and enables the protein in the flour to develop into
                                gluten, which promotes the properties of stretching and expansion in the dough. This results in the light
                                and springy crumb apparent in many breads. Dough that is not adequately kneaded results in bread that is too
                                heavy and dense when baked.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">A large, smooth work surface is necessary for kneading.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> It is essential that food is correctly portioned to ensure that the right amount of
                                        customers are served from the dish/products and budgetary requirements are met. Pre-portioning
                                        products ready for heating will ensure that the correct size and portion numbers can be achieved.

                                    <li><strong>Proving:</strong> Proving is the rising period, often known as proofing, when the yeast cells in a dough

                            <li><strong>Resting:</strong> A term used to describe the resting period for pastry dough, which is important to prevent
                                shrinkage before baking. The product or dough should be wrapped in plastic and placed in the refrigerator
                                for at least 30 minutes before rolling out. This will allow the elasticity which was built up during mixing
                                to relax.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Rolling:</strong> When preparing a sweet paste to line a baked apple pie, the pastry should be rolled and then the
                                moulds lined with sweet paste. This technique could also be used in the production of other baked pies.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Similar to marking; items can be scored to enhance their appearance and allow them to be baked
                                more quickly, and to allow flavours to absorb into the flesh or the product more easily.

                            <li><strong>Shaping:</strong> Certain items may need to be shaped before baking. For example, a yeasted dough may need to be cut
                                and formed into a variety of different shapes such as bread lattices, rolls, etc. All items should be
                                carefully shaped, taking care not to over-handle the products.

                            <li><strong>Weighing:</strong> Weighing is essential when preparing baked goods, especially for pastry products. Proper
                                measuring of ingredients is important to successful cooking and baking. Some foods can be greatly affected
                                by too much or too little of certain ingredients, such as water, salt, baking soda, baking powder and hot or
                                spicy ingredients. There are several different types of measuring utensils used for proper measuring of
                                ingredients, such as kitchen scales or measuring jugs.

                            <li><strong>Humidity control:</strong> Humidity can have an effect on how food bakes, but it is something that traditional ovens (with no steam injection) have no control over. Water molecules conduct heat much faster than air. Not only does humid air transfer heat more efficiently to food, cooking it more quickly, it also helps prevent the water in the food from evaporating, keeping the moisture locked inside. While dry heat in an oven can be a good thing when you want a deeply browned crust on a pie, it can be a problem with many other types of food in which it is preferable to retain moisture.

                            <li><strong>Positioning within oven:</strong> It is important to consider how an oven works. There will be some variation in temperature in different areas of a traditional oven, even if the temperature of the oven is set. This is because cold air in the oven will sink to the bottom and hotter air will rise to the top, with the result that the top shelf of the oven will be hotter than the bottom shelf. During the baking process, you may be required to move items between the shelves to achieve even baking.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">A fan assisted oven uses convection currents to cook food. Fans are used to distribute hot air around the oven, which helps to cook the food more evenly and quickly than in a conventional gas or electric style oven.</li>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it
                                comes to the recipe cooking time. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not
                                overcooked.

                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of baked products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do
                                not overcook and that they are not undercooked when removed from the oven. This can be done easily,
                                especially with meats, pastry, vegetables and fish, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the
                                product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily or cleanly from the product, it would suggest it
                                is done.

It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing baked products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish. For example, a whole baked fish Thai style could be garnished with sliced spring onions, sliced chillies and chopped coriander.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Glazing:</strong> Glazing adds flavour and colour to a dish; for example, a baked ham could be glazed with a
                                        honey and brown sugar glaze, then finished at a high temperature in the oven to caramelise the
                                        sugars, giving the ham a rich golden colour and flavour. A baked Chelsea bun could be finished and
                                        glazed with a sugar syrup.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> A baked product such as a large pie could be divided into individual portions by
                                        cutting, for ease of service.
                                    </li>

                            <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing baked products. Like garnishing, it adds flavour and texture, improving the appearance of the overall dish. For example, a baked fish fillet could be served with a butter sauce such as a hollandaise, or a Thai-style dressing.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is important that a suitable and correct sauce is used when saucing baked products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing.</li>
