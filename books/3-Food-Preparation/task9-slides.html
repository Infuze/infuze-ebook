                        Introduction to steaming
                    </h1>

                    <p>Steaming is a moist heat cooking method that results in tender and flavourful food. Unlike braising and stewing, the food product is not actually placed in the heated liquid, but is suspended above it. </p>

                    <p>The steaming process is simple; as the water boils, the steam rises and surrounds the food with heat and moisture, cooking the food until it is tender. It is best to use smaller cuts of meat or smaller pieces of vegetables for steaming.</p>

                            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Steaming is a technique for cooking rice that is very popular in Asian countries. It produces perfectly cooked rice. It is a method well suited to glutinous or sticky varieties of rice, because steaming reduces some of the natural stickiness of the rice. When sticky rice is cooked with the boiling or absorption methods, the grains tend to stick together, forming a large mass.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">There are several methods of steaming rice: bamboo steamer, electric steamer, traditional stove-top wet method and professional kitchen steamer. Nearly all of these methods require the rice to be washed first in order to remove some of the starch so that the rice will be less sticky when it is cooked.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Steaming vegetables is a popular cooking method, as it is the best method of retaining the water-soluble vitamins found in the vegetables. You are more easily able to control the doneness of vegetables using the steaming method. Most vegetables can be steamed.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are steamed, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example is skinning fish before steaming.</li>
                            <li><strong>Folding:</strong> Some foods should be folded before steaming; for example, when steaming fillets of a flat fish, you might stuff the fillets and then fold them over before steaming.</li>
                            <li><strong>Creaming/rubbing in:</strong> When producing certain sweet puddings, for example, steam jam pudding, or savoury puddings such as steak and kidney pudding, there is a requirement for the sponge mixture or the pastry to be prepared using in the rubbing in or creaming method.</li>

                            <li><strong>Greasing:</strong> There may be a requirement to grease moulds or baking trays before steaming to ensure that they don’t stick. This is important when making sweet and savoury puddings that have been steamed in moulds and are required to be released from the mould.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lining:</strong> Similar to greasing, you may need to line a mould or a pan with grease, clingfilm or parchment paper, so that the dish doesn’t stick to the mould or pan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mixing/folding in:</strong> Similar to combining and mixing, folding in is the gentle mixing of ingredients together.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rolling:</strong> When preparing a suet paste to line a steamed steak and kidney pudding, the pastry should be rolled and then the moulds lined with suet paste. This technique could also be used in the production of Asian steamed buns.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Portioning:</strong> It is essential that food is correctly portioned to ensure that the right amount of customers are served from the dish; this will also ensure that budgetary requirements are met and that you don’t over- or under-produce a dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sealing:</strong> Food can be sealed before steaming in a parcel made from banana leaves or parchment paper along with additional flavourings, in order that these flavours and aromas will infuse the food being cooked. For example, a fillet of fish might be steamed along with lemon grass and curry leaves, wrapped in banana leaves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> When steaming food products, the water or liquid should be at the correct temperature, which is around 85&#176;C to 100&#176;C. The liquid should be brought up to boiling point (100&#176;C) and then reduced as required to produce the necessary steam.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining away the liquid over which food has been steamed. If the food is not removed from the residual steam it can make the final product soggy in texture, or the product may still continue to cook. Steamed food products should always be drained prior to service.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pressure (high/low):</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Low pressure</strong> steaming food may be cooked by direct or indirect contact with the steam: direct – in a steamer or in a pan of boiling water, eg steak and kidney pudding; indirect – between two plates over a pan of boiling water.</li>
                                    <li><strong>High pressure</strong> steaming food usually takes place in purpose-built equipment which does not allow the steam to escape, therefore enabling steam pressure to build up, increasing the temperature and reducing cooking time.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Refreshing:</strong> Blanched or steamed food can be plunged into a cold water bath (ice can be used; this is known as ‘shocking’) in order to stop any further cooking. Blanching helps to maintain some of the water-soluble vitamins that can be lost during the steaming process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Blanched foods such as poultry, vegetables or rice may need to be refreshed/reheated in a steamer prior to service. This can ensure good portion control is maintained, as the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.

                            <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to the recipe cooking time. As with boiling or poaching, over-steaming will lead to a product that is squidgy or soft in texture, and can affect the overall flavour of the finished product. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> When steaming food products, the water or liquid should be at the correct temperature, which is around 85&#176;C to 100&#176;C. The liquid should be brought up to boiling point (100&#176;C) and then reduced as required to produce the necessary steam.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of steamed products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily, especially with puddings, fish, poultry and vegetables, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily or clean from the product, it would suggest it is done.</li>

                            <li><strong>Correcting seasoning:</strong> Seasoning is key to the overall taste of the finished product, so always check your seasoning throughout the poaching process. Remember: you can easily add seasoning to a dish, but it is much harder to try and correct a dish that has been over-seasoned.</li>
                            <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing steamed foods as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing steamed products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish.</li>

                            <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing steamed food products. Steamed foods often require additional sauces to improve their appearance and add flavour and texture.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is important that a suitable and correct sauce is used when saucing steamed products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing. For example, steamed chicken breast can be sauced with a white sauce with herbs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Turning out:</strong> Some steamed foods such as rice and puddings may need to be turned out of moulds. Steaming foods in a mould will give a specific shape to the finished product. For instance, you could steam a golden syrup pudding in a pudding-basin-shaped mould; once cooked, you would then gently turn it out of the mould for presentation.</li>
