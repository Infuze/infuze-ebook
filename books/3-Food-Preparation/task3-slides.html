                            <p>Stewing is a moist heat cooking process much like braising, except that the meat is totally immersed in liquid rather than being only partially immersed as it is with braising.</p>
                            <p>Another difference is that the meat used for stewing is usually cut into smaller pieces, rather than being left as one large piece. Many of the same cuts that are suitable for braising are ideal as stewing meat.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Fruit:</strong> Stewing is a good way of slow-cooking fruits such as plums, peaches and rhubarb. It is also used as preserved fruit, which has been stewed or cooked in a heavy, sugary syrup and is served as a dessert.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Rhubarb is commonly stewed. Because rhubarb varies in sweetness, it is hard to determine how much sugar is needed. The rhubarb will also sweeten as it cooks. Start out with a small amount of sugar. Once the rhubarb has cooked, more sugar can be added if necessary.</li>

                            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Meat stews are often prepared with tougher cuts of meat that have been cut into small pieces. Many of the same cuts that are suitable for braising are ideal as stewing meat. Cuts from the shoulder and flank of different breeds are often used, as well as meat from lamb shanks, etc.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">There are many variations of stews, including recipes that are basically the same as beef stew except that lamb is used instead of beef. Other types of stew include a variety of dishes native to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and northern Africa that are cooked in a tagine, which is an earthenware pot with a conical lid. ‘Tagine’ is also the Moroccan word for stew. Many of these recipes include ingredients such as dried prunes, onions, garlic, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, lemon, saffron, cumin, turmeric, and honey. They are often served with couscous or lentils.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">When stewing, the meat can be lightly coated with flour before searing to aid in browning, but this is not essential.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> Most types of poultry can be stewed but it is most popular with chicken, especially when using older birds that can be tough if cooked too quickly and tend to cook better over a longer period of time.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Chicken joints such as the leg, thigh and breast can be stewed whole on the bone, or can be taken off the bone and cut into chunks.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Poultry meat can easily become dry and stringy, so it is important to keep the liquid at a simmer through the stewing process. Do not allow it to boil.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Root vegetables such as carrots, swede and tubers are the most suitable vegetables to be stewed, as they are hard in texture. They can be stewed along with meat, adding flavour to the dish.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and freshness:</strong> Always try and use fresh produce. The product should look and appear fresh. There should be no sign of mould or decay or bad aroma, as this would indicate that the product is past its best. If this is the case, the items should be removed, other items should be checked and the supervisor should be informed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Size and shape:</strong> The product should be the correct size and shape; it is important that when selecting and preparing items for stewing they are roughly equal in size, to ensure even cooking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Vegetable items for stewing should be firm in texture prior to cooking. Squidgy or soft items (often indicating an older, less fresh vegetable) will tend to absorb more liquid during the cooking process.</li>

                            <li><strong>Blanching:</strong> The cooking of food in boiling water for only a short amount of time, to retain the colour and to help preserve the nutrients.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">The blanching procedure involves placing small quantities of food into a large amount of rapidly boiling water for the amount of time specified in the recipe. This method can be useful when preparing vegetables for a stew or curry.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are stewed, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example might be peeling carrots before stewing.</li>

                            <li><strong>Searing/browning:</strong> The process of quickly browning the surface of food by exposing it to extremely high heat. When used in stewing, meat is most often seared in a small quantity of oil and then added to cooking liquid/liquor along with vegetables and stewed for a long period of time. The meat is seared to provide a flavourful brown outer crust on its surface as the natural sugars cook and caramelise. This is known as the Maillard reaction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Selection and preparation of appropriate cooking liquid:</strong> It is important when stewing food to ensure that the stewing liquid is appropriate. The stewing liquid will add flavour and texture to the food. Fresh stewing liquid can be used, or convenience products. Suitable liquids/liquor may include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>water</li>
                                    <li>stock (meat, shellfish, fish, white chicken, vegetable, court bouillon)</li>

                            <li><strong>Covering:</strong> Some dishes may require the food item to be covered in order to keep in the heat and flavours and stop the stewing liquid evaporating. Covering with a lid or tinfoil will form a ‘ceiling’ and help to keep in the moisture and prevent the top of the food item from drying out. This will ensure that the finished stewed food item is moist throughout.</li>
                            <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining the liquid from stewed fruit before using it as part of a dish.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Reduction:</strong> A reduction of wine, stock or other liquid can be added to a stew as an intense base flavour. Reducing is the process of thickening and intensifying the flavour of a liquid by rapidly boiling the contents in an uncovered pan so that the excess liquid evaporates.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Stewed foods may need to be refreshed/reheated prior to service. This can be done in the oven, on the stove top or in a microwave. It can help to ensure good portion control is maintained, as the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.</li>

This can be used when cooking items such as curries and stews.</li>
                            <li><strong>Straining:</strong> Similar to draining, there may be a requirement to strain excess liquid or unwanted fats, liquids or oil from a stewed dish. This can be done using a ladle or spoon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> It is very important at all stages of handling, preparation and cooking of food for stewing that the temperature of the food is monitored to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. Prior to cooking, all food for stewing should be stored in the correct cold refrigeration at a temperature of 3&#176;C–8&#176;C until required.</li>

As with boiling, overcooking will lead to a product that is squidgy or soft in texture, and can affect the overall flavour. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Flavour:</strong> Always check the flavour during the cooking process by tasting. This should be done with a disposable or metal spoon. The spoon should be cleaned between each tasting to avoid any cross-contamination. Remember that as a dish cooks, the flavours develop and change.</li>

                            <li><strong>Sufficient liquid:</strong> It is important when stewing food that there is sufficient liquid for the product to be fully covered, but only just. There should not be too much liquid compared to the size of the product being stewed. Overfilling the pan will mean that it takes too long for the water and product to heat up to the correct temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature and movement of the liquid:</strong> The type of product being stewed determines whether a rapid, slow or rolling boiling/stewing method should be used. When checking the temperature, always stir the stew prior to temperature probing to eliminate any ‘cold spots’ in the stew.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of stewed products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily, especially with meats, vegetables and fruits, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily from the product, it would suggest it is done.</li>

                            <li><strong>Correcting consistency:</strong> The finished stewed product should have the correct consistency, depending on the dish; for instance, in a Irish stew the sauce around the meat and vegetables would be a lot thinner compared to a curry or brown stew. The consistency of the sauce around the product may need to be thickened or thinned down with stock, depending on the requirements of the dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Correcting seasoning:</strong> Seasoning is key to the overall taste of the finished product. Always check the seasoning throughout the stewing process. Remember, you can easily add seasoning to a dish, but it is much harder to try and correct a dish that has been over-seasoned.</li>
                            <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing stewed foods, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing stewed products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish.</li>

                            <p>It is important that the cooking vessel is equipped with a tight-fitting lid so that the liquid does not evaporate. Braising is a process that maintains the natural juices and flavours of the food while tenderising the ingredients.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Braising is a process of slow-cooking tougher cuts of meat in liquid in order to add flavour and to moisten and tenderise the meat. This technique is also often known as pot-roasting.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">In a cheaper cut of meat such as a flank or rib, there is a pattern of connective tissues and thick marbling that makes the meat tough if it is not cooked with a method that melts these tissues. Dry heat-cooking methods, such as oven roasting, do not allow the internal temperature of the meat to become high enough to break down the fat and connective tissues.</li>
                                    <li style="list-style: none">Braising is a much more effective means for breaking down these tough fibres. The internal temperature of the meat reaches a level that is sufficiently high to melt the connective tissues and fat. The moisture in the pan prevents the outer portions of the meat from drying out.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> Braising and stewing are very similar methods of cooking poultry. They both use the same process of searing to enhance colour and flavour, and slow cooking in liquid to produce tender, moist meat. Once the meat is browned, it is cooked in a covered pan in the oven. It is best to use the same pan that was used to sear the meat, so you get all the benefit of the flavoured pieces in the bottom of the pan when making a sauce. Select a heavy sauté or frying pan that is suitable for both the stove top and the oven. The pan should also have a fairly tight-fitting lid to prevent moisture from escaping.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Braised rice is a simple dish to produce, with little effort required. Onions and carrots or similar vegetables are sweated off in an ovenproof pan, the raw rice is added and then hot stock. The mixture is brought to the boil and then removed. A cartouche or lid is placed on top of the rice, and it is placed in the oven.</li>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and freshness:</strong> Always try and use fresh produce. The product should look and appear fresh. There should be no sign of mould or decay or bad aroma, as this would indicate that the product is past its best. If this is the case, the items should be removed, other items should be checked and the supervisor should be informed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Size and shape:</strong> The product should be the correct size and shape; it is important when selecting and preparing items for braising that they are roughly equal in size, to ensure even cooking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Vegetable items for braising should be firm in texture prior to cooking. Squidgy or soft items (often indicating an older, less fresh vegetable) will tend to absorb more liquid during the cooking process.</li>

                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are braised, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example might be cutting a chicken into portions before braising.</li>
                            <li><strong>Searing/browning:</strong> The process of quickly browning the surface of food by exposing it to extremely high heat. As with stewing, when this technique is used in braising, meat is most often seared in a small quantity of oil and then added to cooking liquid/liquor along with vegetables and braised for a long period of time. The meat is seared to provide a flavourful brown outer crust on its surface as the natural sugars cook and caramelise. This is known as the Maillard reaction.</li>

                            <li><strong>Selection and preparation of appropriate cooking liquid:</strong> It is important when braising food to ensure that a good flavoursome liquid is used. The braising liquid will add flavour and texture to the food. Fresh braising liquid can be used, or convenience products. Suitable liquids/liquor may include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>water</li>
                                    <li>stock (meat, shellfish, fish, white chicken, vegetable, court bouillon)</li>

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Covering:</strong> Some dishes may require the food to be covered in order to keep in the heat and flavours and stop them from evaporating. Covering with a lid or tinfoil will form a ‘ceiling’ and help to keep in the moisture and prevent the top of the food item from drying out. This will ensure that the finished braised food item is moist throughout.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining the excess cooking liquid/liquor from a braised joint of meat. The cooking liquid/liquor could then be reduced /thickened and made into a sauce.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Braised foods such as braised beef may need to be refreshed/reheated prior to service. This can be done in the oven, on the stove top or in a microwave. It can help to ensure good portion control is maintained, as the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.</li>

This can be used when cooking items such as boeuf bourguignon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Straining:</strong> Similar to draining, there may be a requirement to strain excess liquid or unwanted fats, liquids or oil from a braised dish. This can be done using a ladle or spoon.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> It is very important at all stages of handling, preparation and cooking of food for braising that the temperature of the food is monitored to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. Prior to cooking, all food for braising should be stored in the correct cold refrigeration at a temperature of 3&#176;C–8&#176;C until required. All food should be thoroughly heated and kept out of the temperature danger zone.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to the recipe cooking time. As with boiling, overcooking will lead to a product that is squidgy or soft in texture, and can affect the overall flavour. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Flavour:</strong> Always check the flavour during the cooking process by tasting. This should be done with a disposable or metal spoon. The spoon should be cleaned between each tasting to avoid any cross-contamination. Remember that as a dish cooks, the flavours develop and change.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sufficient liquid:</strong> It is important when braising products that there is sufficient liquid for the dish. The pan used should be just large enough so that any liquid can freely move around the product. There should not be too much liquid compared to the size of the product being braised.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature and movement of the liquid:</strong> The type of product being braised determines whether a high or low temperature should be used. In most cases, the ideal temperature for braising is low to medium over a long period of time, allowing the product to cook gently and be tender. When checking the temperature, always stir prior to temperature probing to eliminate any ‘cold spots’.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of braised products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily, especially with meats, vegetables and fruits, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily from the product, it would suggest it is done.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Correcting consistency:</strong> The finished braised product should have the correct consistency, depending on the dish; for instance, in a boeuf bourguignon the sauce around the meat and vegetables would be thicker than in a braised one-pot chicken. The consistency of the sauce around the product may need to be thickened or thinned down with stock, depending on the requirements of the dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Correcting seasoning:</strong> Seasoning is key to the overall taste of the finished product. Always check the seasoning throughout the braising process. Remember, you can easily add seasoning to a dish, but it is much harder to try and correct a dish that has been over-seasoned.</li>
                            <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing braised foods, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing braised products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish.</li>

                            <li><strong>Reducing:</strong> You may need to reduce the braising liquid/liquor after an item has been braised. Reducing is the process of thickening and intensifying the flavour of a liquid by rapidly boiling it in an uncovered pan so that the excess liquid evaporates. It is a similar process to deglazing, but is not the same.</li>
                            <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing braised food products. A lot of flavour will have come out of the meat or poultry during the cooking process, and this can then be used to form the basis of the sauce. The cooking liquor from a braised dish will usually be rich in flavour and depth.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is important that an appropriate sauce is used when saucing braised products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; the sauce should represent part of the dish and complement the other ingredients. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing.</li>
