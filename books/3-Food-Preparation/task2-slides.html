                            <p>Boiling is the process of heating liquid to the temperature at which it will begin to transform into a gaseous state, which is 100&#176;C when
                                water is boiled at sea level. Water will boil more quickly at higher altitudes where the air pressure is lower as it takes less energy,
                                which means water will boil at a lower temperature.</p>

                            <p>In cooking, it is easy to tell when a liquid reaches the boiling point because gas bubbles appear on the surface of the liquid and steam
                                rises from the cooking vessel. There are different levels of boiling in cooking, such as a fast or vigorous boil, required for cooking
                                pasta or potatoes, and a slow boil or simmer, which is required for many other food items. In addition, a rolling or roiling boil involves
                                the process of heating liquids to a temperature where stirring will not alter the turbulent or vigorous bubbling action.</p>

                            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Boiled eggs can be cooked to different degrees of doneness from soft to medium to hard-boiled, depending on customer choice. Eggs should never be cooked at a full boil for the duration of their cooking time. Eggs cooked in the shell with heat that is too high, or with a cooking time that is excessive, will become tough and rubbery, and a dark line may form between the yolk and the white.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grains:</strong> Grains such as bulgur wheat can be boiled. The grains are cooked uncovered in a large quantity of water. The grains and water are then drained into a colander for several minutes to remove the excess moisture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Meats:</strong> The boiling method can be used for such dishes as boiled ham and beef. Slow boiling for a long period of time will ensure that the meat is tender and moist. It is important that the internal temperature of the joint of meat is checked, to ensure thorough cooking.</li>

The boiled items can then be drained or used as part of the finished dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Poultry:</strong> Poultry is rarely boiled in today’s professional kitchen. If used, it may be for a basic white chicken stock; or the chicken can be boiled with root vegetables, cooled and then the meat picked from the bones to use in a chicken dish.</li>

                            <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Boiling is a common method for cooking all different types of pasta. It is also used in conjunction with some of the other cooking methods, such as stir-frying and baking. Boiled and cooled pasta may need to be refreshed/reheated in boiling water prior to service. The pasta is cooked uncovered in a large quantity of salted water. The pasta and salted water are then drained in a colander for a minute or so to remove any excess moisture.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Dried pasta:</strong> Dried pasta will take longer to cook than fresh pasta and cooking time will depend on size, shape and thickness of the pasta. The water should have reached a full boil. Add all the pasta and stir immediately to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stuffed pasta:</strong> Stuffed pasta, such as ravioli, should be cooked more gently than most other pastas to prevent it from splitting apart. Keep the water at a gentle boil while the pasta is cooking.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fresh pasta:</strong> Fresh and homemade pasta take much less time to cook than dried pasta. Some types can be done in less than 30 seconds after the pasta comes back to a full boil.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> Boiling is one of the easiest methods for cooking rice. The rice is cooked uncovered in a large quantity of water. The rice and water are then drained into a colander for several minutes to remove the excess moisture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Boiling is a common method of cooking vegetables, especially root or firm vegetables. Boiling vegetables for only a short amount of time will help to retain their colour and to preserve nutrients. Over-boiling will destroy the water-soluble vitamins within the vegetables.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Vegetables suitable for boiling include potatoes, carrots, swede, turnip, cauliflower and broccoli.</li>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and freshness:</strong> Always try and use fresh produce. The product should look and appear fresh. There should be no sign of mould or decay or bad aroma, as this would indicate that the product is past its best. If this is the case, the items should be removed, other items should be checked and the supervisor should be informed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Size and shape:</strong> The product should be the correct size and shape; it is important that when selecting and preparing items for boiling they are roughly equal in size, to ensure even cooking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Vegetable items for boiling should be firm in texture prior to cooking. Squidgy or soft items (often indicating an older, less fresh vegetable) will tend to absorb more water during the cooking process.</li>

                            <li style="list-style: none">The blanching procedure involves placing small quantities of food into a large amount of rapidly boiling water for the amount of time specified in the recipe. Food is added in small quantities so that the boiling process is not disturbed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Draining:</strong> The process of pouring off the excess liquid or fat from food; for example, draining the water from boiled carrots, pasta or potatoes. If the excess liquid it is not removed it can make the final product soggy in texture, or the product may still continue to cook in the excess water. Draining can be achieved using a slotted spoon, colander or sieve. Boiled food products should always be drained prior to service.</li>

                            <li><strong>Refreshing:</strong> After being removed from the boiling water, blanched food should be plunged into a cold water bath (ice can be used; this is known as ‘shocking’) in order to stop any further cooking. Blanching helps to maintain some of the water-soluble vitamins that can be lost during the boiling process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Blanched foods such as carrots or broccoli may need to be refreshed/reheated in boiling water prior to service. This can ensure good portion control is maintained, as the chef will need only to reheat the amount that they need; time is saved during service, and, importantly, there is less risk of food being overcooked during busy service times.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Reheated boiled products should reach a minimum core temperature of 75&#176;C.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Skimming:</strong> The process of removing unwanted excess fluid, scum, fats, particles and food from the surface of a liquid, using a spoon with small holes or a fine mesh for draining but not releasing the skimmed items. This can be used when cooking items such as joints of meat i.e. boiled ham. Alternative methods include, for removing fat from liquid, the use of ice cubes wrapped in cheesecloth: quickly drag the ice over the top of the liquid and the fat will cling to the ice. Remove before the ice melts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> It is very important at all stages of handling, preparation and cooking of foods for boiling that the temperature of the foods is monitored to avoid the multiplication of harmful bacteria. Prior to cooking, all high-risk foods for boiling should be stored in the correct cold refrigeration at a temperature of between 3&#176;C and 8&#176;C until required.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">When boiling food, the water or liquid should be at the correct temperature for boiling, which is 100&#176;C.</li>

                            <li><strong>Appearance and degree of cooking:</strong> Ensuring that the product is cooked but not overcooked is key when it comes to the recipe cooking time. Over-boiling/overcooking will lead to a product that is squidgy or soft in texture and can affect the overall flavour of the finished product. Regular checks should be undertaken to ensure that the product is not overcooked. Fully submerging the product during the cooking process will ensure that all parts remain moist.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sufficient liquid:</strong> It is important when boiling products that there is sufficient water for the product to be fully submerged. The pan used should be just large enough so that the liquid can cover the product and move freely around it. It should not have too much liquid compared to the size of the product being boiled. Overfilling the pan will mean that it takes too long for the water and product to heat up to the correct temperature.</li>

                            <li><strong>Temperature and movement of the liquid:</strong> Depending on the product being cooked you may need to use a rapid, slow or rolling boiling method. Vigorous or turbulent boiling cannot be disrupted or stopped by stirring. This method is suitable for certain types of dishes, but can also affect the texture of some products by overcooking the outside but not the inside.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Adding cold water to top up a pan increases the amount of time required for boiling. The correct temperature for boiling water is 100&#176;C.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of boiled products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily, especially with vegetables and tubers, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily from the product, it would suggest it is done.</li>

                            <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing boiled foods as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing boiled products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product, and complement the dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing boiled food products. Boiled foods often require additional sauces to improve their appearance and add flavour and texture, as boiling in water tends not to add flavour to the product.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">It is important that a suitable and correct sauce is used when saucing boiled products. Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing. For example, sliced boiled ham can be dressed with a simple mustard sauce.</li>
