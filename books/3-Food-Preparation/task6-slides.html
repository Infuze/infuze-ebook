                            <p><strong>Grilling</strong> is the process of cooking with direct and indirect heat. It is important to understand the differences between the two methods to ensure success when grilling. Grilled food is most often cooked with one or the other of these cooking methods, but occasionally both methods are alternated to grill certain foods; this is particularly useful when grilling thick cuts of meat. The temperature required and the grilling method used will depend on the type of food and the thickness of the cut.</p>

                            <li><strong>Batting out:</strong> Some items, such as meat or poultry, may need to be batted out to reduce their thickness in order to encourage even, quick cooking. This process also helps to reduce the toughness of meat fibres in a cut of meat or poultry by tenderising the meat. Tenderising breaks down the fibres and softens the meat, making it easier to chew and more palatable.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: none">Meat can also be batted out with the use of meat mallets or meat utensils, typically made of steel or similar alloys. The tenderising tools are hammer-like handled utensils, made with a flat or point-protruding surface that can be pounded into the meat to break apart the meat fibres. The meat items can be put between two pieces of clingfilm or parchment paper and batted out to reduce the damage to the surface of the meat. Items that are typically batted out are chicken breasts for escalopes or veal steaks for schnitzel.</li>

                            <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Some food items, before they are grilled, should be prepared by cutting with knives or small cutting equipment. Cutting techniques may involve chopping, coring, cutting into batons, dicing, filleting, jointing, marking and scoring, peeling, skinning, slicing, trimming and turning/shaping. An example is cutting a chicken into portions before grilling.</li>
                            <li><strong>Marinating:</strong> Marinating is the process of soaking food in a seasoned liquid for the purpose of flavouring and tenderising it before cooking. Meat is often marinated in preparation for grilling, and can be soaked in a marinade for anywhere from two to twelve hours (even more in some circumstances). The marinade should totally cover the meat in order for it to work effectively. It is important to store the meat in its marinade in the refrigerator to minimise the growth of bacteria.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Meat, poultry, fish or vegetables for grilling should be thoroughly seasoned before the cooking process; this will enable the flavours to soak through during grilling.</li>

                            <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> As with an oven, there will often be ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ spots within a grill. The grill gives direct heat from either the bottom or the top, and it is important that the food is positioned correctly in relation to how you want it cooked. If you want a lot of colour quickly, it would make sense to place it close to the flame/heat; if you want to cook more slowly, you would position it slightly further away.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> A grill will generally be very hot so as to provide quick, high heat, so it must be managed accordingly. During the cooking process it is important to control the heat to ensure even cooking and colouring of the product.</li>
                            <li><strong>Turning:</strong> When grilling, it is important to turn the food so as to ensure even colouring and cooking and avoid over-browning. This can easily be done using a slice, a cooking fork or a pair of food tongs.</li>
                        </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Texture:</strong> Always check the texture of grilled products throughout the cooking process to ensure that they do not overcook. This can be done easily, especially with meats, vegetables and poultry, by inserting a small knife or skewer to see if the product is cooked. If the knife or skewer comes out easily and cleanly and no blood emerges from the product, it would suggest it is done.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnishing is important when finishing grilled foods, as it can add flavour and texture as well as improving the appearance of the overall dish. It is important that a suitable and correct garnish is used when garnishing grilled products. Don’t garnish a finished product just for the sake of it; the garnish should represent part of the product, and complement the dish. For example, a grilled fillet steak could be garnished with grilled tomatoes, mushrooms and a pepper sauce, while grilled tuna fish could be garnished with a slice of lemon and a sprig of parsley.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Saucing:</strong> Saucing is an important factor when finishing grilled products. Like garnishing, it adds flavour and texture, improving the appearance of the overall dish. For example, pan-grilled fish fillets could be served with a butter sauce such as a hollandaise, or grilled vegetables could be served with a chilli and lime dressing.</li>

Don’t add a sauce to a finished product just for the sake of it; it should represent part of the product and complement the dish. It is possible to serve the sauce separately, allowing the customer to add their own sauce or dressing</li>
