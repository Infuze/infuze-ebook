                                    <li>Health, safety and hygiene requirements must always be considered during the preparation of vegetable proteins. Cutting and cooking food always involves some risks, however, these can be minimised by supervision, training, reinforcement and following correct procedures.</li>
                                    <li>Tofu takes on the flavours that it is cooked with or marinated with, so adding spices, herbs and flavours will change a bland tasting product into a versatile ingredient.</li>
                                    <li>Many vegetable proteins dishes will use vegetables along with the vegetable proteins to make the dishes.</li>
                                    <li>You must also consider, washing vegetables for use in vegetable protein dishes prior to use is essential for removing dust, bacteria, pesticides, wax and other contaminants.</li>

                                    <li>One cup boiling or hot water or vegetable stock poured over 1 cup of small TVP granules will reconstitute in five to 10 minutes. For larger chunks or slices, use 2 cups of liquid to 1 cup of chunks/slices and simmer for 20-30 minutes until tender, but not mushy. TVP or TSP granules or flakes can be rehydrated in a microwave, by covering the moistened granules and cooking on high for about five minutes.</li>
                                    <li>TVP or TSP will equal about 1:2 in weight of minced lamb/beef once it has been fully soaked i.e. 1kg of TVP will represent 2kg of traditional meat once fully reconstituted. Unflavoured textured soy protein easily assumes the flavour of other liquids and foods. As you soak the TVP, it will become plump and look more like real meat or poultry.</li>
                                    <li>It can also be combined with normal meat or poultry to boast protein values for non-vegetarians.</li>

                                    <li>When it comes to texture, tofu is incredibly versatile. A simple way to alter the consistency is by slicing the tofu before pressing, as opposed to pressing the whole block. This will push a lot more water out of the tofu, making the tofu pieces considerably firmer.</li>
                                    <li>Switching up the shapes and sizes of tofu pieces before pressing can also really have an effect on texture.</li>
                                    <li>Marinating pressed tofu for at least 30 minutes will ensure it soaks up strong flavoured marinades, such as curry pastes, soy sauce, garlic or heavily spiced mixes. This gives time for the flavours to penetrate into the nooks and crannies of the tofu.</li>

                            <p>The restaurant industry is very competitive and often the little touches provided on a plate make all the difference. Cooking vegetables differently can provide an inexpensive option for differentiating your establishment.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Nutrition</strong> – steamed vegetable protein dishes retain more nutrients, such as steamed oriental vegetables and vegetable protein with a honey and soy glaze and steamed rice.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Eye appeal</strong> – glazed vegetable protein dishes are glossy and look appetising, such as soy glazed tofu. Coat the tofu in a sauce then reducing the amount of liquid by heating either in a sauté pan or in the oven to drive off the moisture and concentrate the flavours.</li>

                            <p>The majority of vegetable proteins are suitable for deep-/Shallow-frying. They can be coated, through dry and/or wet ingredients, such as flour, egg, breadcrumbs, batter, etc.</p>
                            <p>There are a few reasons for coating; the coating applied to the vegetable proteins acts as a barrier that keeps the item from overcooking as it cooks; it enables the exterior of the food to become crisp and darken evenly without burning; and it prevents the texture of the food from becoming tough.​</p>
                            <p>Before coating, the vegetable protein should first be lightly dried by patting the food item with paper towels or left to drain to absorb excess moisture.</p>

                            <p>The stir-frying method of cooking is widely used in Asian cooking and is said to encourage the sealing in of the flavours, nutrients, as well as adding colour to the dish. Most vegetable proteins can be stir-fried in one form or another, either from fresh or after they have been marinated, cooked and refreshed.​</p>

                            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and gently cook the carrots and onions for 5 minutes until softened but not browned. Add the garlic and mushrooms and cook for a further 5 minutes. Stir in the vegetable stock, porcini mushrooms and white wine.</li>

Fold the outer edges of the tubes inwards to seal the ends and then place on a greased baking tray.</li>
