                            <p>Catering operations must not only appeal to customers; they must also return a profit.
                            </p>

                            <p>The menu and pricing must also take into account the variations in cost of food. Meat, vegetables and seafood fluctuate according to their seasonal availability and demand. If demand is high the prices will also rise.
                            </p>

                            <p>In order for any establishment to remain in profit, then careful costing of dishes and any wastage must be calculated correctly.

                                <li><strong>Record keeping:</strong> Reliable record keeping is very important, because errors caused by
                                    poor record keeping will affect the overall service delivery in the kitchen.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Stock control includes keeping accurate and reliable records of food commodities
                                            received and issued, stock taking (checking stocks on a regular basis) and carrying
                                            out an inventory of stock.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>A stock control system uses tools such as stock record cards and a stock control
                                            spreadsheet. Effective stock control is important to help you order the right
                                            quantities of supplies. Ideally, you should carry out a stock take before placing an
                                            order for more food commodities, but this will be decided by the size of your
                                            establishment and stock size.

                                <li><strong>Seasonal demand:</strong> In some areas of food supply with certain availability during the
                                    different seasons, prices are at their lowest when large quantities of stock are
                                    available.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Food commodity supplies are low at the start of the harvest season, so prices are
                                            high. Prices may drop as supply increases. At the end of the season, prices normally
                                            increase again as supply diminishes.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Prices are generally highest during the off-season, when only a small percentage of
                                            farmers are able to grow the crop.

                                        <li>Certain food commodities are seasonal or favourite items at certain times of the
                                            year, such as turkey (Christmas) and game birds (hunting season). As a kitchen you
                                            will need to correctly forecast your supply and demand during this period to ensure
                                            you have sufficient stock.
