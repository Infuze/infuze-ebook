                            <p>Food packaging has a detrimental effect on the environment if not correctly dealt with. In recent times manufacturers have decreased the levels of packaging to meet strict environmental targets set by the government.

                            <p>As a waste product, local councils have also increased the costs involved in its disposal, pressuring suppliers and food businesses to increase the ‘reduce, reuse and recycling’ of packaging.

                            <p>This ongoing trend has seen developments such as milk being delivered in plastic bags rather than bottles, fruit supplied without packaging etc.

                            <p>The most potent reduction in packaging seen in the UK was first introduced in Wales in 2011 – the charge for using plastic bags.
                            </p>

                            <p>This initiative has reduced their use by 71%.
                            </p>

                            <p>A by-product of this has been the money raised from the charge, which is donated to charity. This is estimated at between £17 and £22 million in Wales alone.

                            <p>Sundries are the products you require to run a business which do not normally cost too much but are necessary to provide your service to the customer. This may include paper towels, cleaning equipment such as mops, cleaning chemicals, clingfilm etc.
                            </p>

                            <p>Equipment is a major cost to any business. In a professional kitchen a simple cooker range can cost up to £5,000.

                            <p>Depending on the type of kitchen the costs can become large, if fitting out a new build – anything up to £150,000. Chefs need to understand there is a serious cost involved in equipping a professional kitchen.

                        Food miles
                    </h1>

                    <p>Food miles is the distance that food travels before being consumed. This includes the distance from the processing point of the food, to the supplier and finally the consumer.</p>

                    <p>The effects of food mileage are best seen in figurers:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>95% of the UK fruit market comes from abroad.</li>
                            <li>50% of all vegetables are imported.</li>
                            <li>30% of all transportation within the U, is dedicated to moving food.</li>
                            <li>1% of food is moved by air but this counts for 11% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</li>
                            <li>Rainforests are being cut down at an alarming rate – a football pitch every second – to
                                make way for growing crops.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>One of the best ways to support sustainability and the environment is to reduce this mileage. In doing so, we will:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce carbon emissions through less transport usage.</li>
                            <li>Support a more localised economy.</li>
                            <li>Secure food security in the longer term.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Ways to reduce food miles</strong></p>

                    <p>There are several areas in which we can reduce food miles to support a more sustainable approach for the food industry, including:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Purchase local products – this will support the local community.</li>
                            <li>Use seasonal food on your menus, supporting the local economy.</li>
                            <li>Consider the origin of your food, especially fruit and vegetables. A reduction in food
                                miles will be achieved if a strawberry grown in France is chosen over those grown in
                                Kenya, outside of the UK season.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure a sustainable purchasing policy has been written and is used.</li>
                            <li>Utilise local farm markets.</li>
                            <li>Develop a network with your suppliers and other local business for best practice.</li>
                            <li>Advertise your business’ sustainability credentials to increase customer knowledge.
                            </li>
                            <li>Consider growing your own produce.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Energy in catering
                    </h1>

                    <p>The Kyoto Protocol was signed by the UK in 1998. This protocol commits countries around the world to reduce their greenhouse gases. It recognises that climate change is happening and it has been caused by humans. The focus is on reducing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions around the planet.</p>

                    <p>The EU set three targets for 2020:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce emissions by 20% of 1990 levels</li>
                            <li>Provide 20% of all energy from renewable sources</li>
                            <li>Increase energy efficiency by 20% of 2007 levels</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>This has seen a move away from high-carbon energy sources, such as coal, to more efficient and less polluting sources, such as gas and renewables. Renewables are natural resources that can be converted to energy, such as sunlight, wind, tides and geothermal heat. All can be used, as they are continually replaced by nature.</p>

                    <p>The food and drink processing industry is the fourth largest user of energy in the UK. The catering facilities, within the hospitality industry, typically spend 4–6% of their operating costs in energy. It has been estimated that a typical catering outlet uses 40% of its energy requirements to prepare and store food; the rest of the energy is dispersed within the kitchen as heat.</p>

                    <p>In order for a food business to reduce its costs and become a more efficient user of energy, it will need to consider the following:</p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Equipment – is the equipment being used correctly? Is it being maintained? has it
                                exceeded its efficient life cycle?
                            </li>
                            <li>Staff – are they trained? Are they being supervised? Are good housekeeping practices
                                being observed?
                            </li>
                            <li>Building – is it energy efficient? Has the building been insulated? Is the ventilation
                                system working correctly in the kitchen?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Food businesses can support the targets of both the Kyoto Protocol and the EU by ensuring the efficient use of buildings and equipment. Staff are the most important resource from which to create savings. They must be trained, supervised and updated to ensure best practices, such as following manufacturers’ instructions.</p>

                    <p>Further information to support energy usage and savings can be found on the Carbon Trust website: type ‘sector specific publication’ in the search tool then select ‘food and catering sector overview’.</p>
