                            <p>The way in which a supervisor develops their leadership style and behaviour will effect those that answer to them. There are many different types of leadership style, including:

                        Leadership styles

                            </div>

                            <p>This style of leadership is where all the power is kept by the supervisor and they make all the decisions. The authority to make these decisions remains with the supervisor. These types of leadership can sometimes be seen as overbearing or bullies.
                            </p>

                            <div class="page-u-list">

                            </div>

                            <p>Leaders of the authoritarian style are similar to the autocratic – they tell the chefs what to do and do not expect any input from them. They do not like to be questioned and their focus is on achieving the business goal at all costs.
                            </p>

                            <p>Both these styles affect the morale of the workplace and, with little input from chefs, they will have no ownership of their work output.

                            </div>

                            <p>This leadership style lends itself to teamwork, allowing chefs to be involved in the decision-making and supporting the supervisor to achieve the business aims and objectives.
                            </p>

                            <p>Participative leaders tend to involve chefs in decision-making and problem-solving in the workplace. However, they will have the final say, after listening to everyone’s views.
                            </p>

                            <p>Both these styles need the involvement of the whole team to deliver the output. The supervisor is considered to be part of the team – both professionally and socially.

                            <p>Laissez-faire leaders allow chefs to get on with their work with minimum input. The leader is available if the staff require guidance or information. This style is considered to be the least effective for employees, as they feel they are not being directed.
                            </p>

                            <p>These styles provide both positive and negative characteristics: the laissez-faire taking a hands off approach, while the delegative style gives authority to the team but the supervisor always remains responsible.

                            <p>Supervisors may need to develop different styles of leadership for different situations that may arise in the professional kitchen, such as:</p>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Staff that are highly developed in skills and experience are better suited to
                                        receiving direction from a delegative/laissez-faire leader

                                also be effective in building a team and positive working relationships

                                is set by the supervisor; if the supervisor has bad habits, it is likely the staff will
                                follow these

                                type of behavior, along with being supportive to their own staff and management, will be
                                seen as very professional

This can be seen UK-wide, with the focus on the delivery of apprenticeships as a mean to upgrade and upskill the national workforce. Ideally suited to the younger generations, in recent years it has been adapted to include the whole UK workforce.
