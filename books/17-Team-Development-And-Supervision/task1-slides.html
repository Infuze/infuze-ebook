                                <p>As a supervisor within the professional kitchen environment you should understand the need to plan with regards to:
                                </p>

                                            being met. Good communication skills are of the upmost importance in order
                                            to keep your team informed

                                        <li><strong>Development of work schedules</strong> – supervisors must ensure their team meets
                                            the output requirements of the business. Supervisors achieve this by
                                            managing one of their most important resources – manpower. This scheduling
                                            includes planning work rotas, as well as task allocation to meet output.

                                            to see unsafe practices and intervene before accidents occur. Supervisors
                                            will also develop working relationships with staff and good monitoring
                                            procedures can see changes in attitudes or behaviours. This monitoring will

                        Forecasting of resources
                    </h1>

                    <p>Supervisors must monitor their resources to ensure they can provide the finished product for the customer. This includes:
                    </p>

                    <div class="page-u-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Staff</strong> – forecasting staff is essential if the output of the kitchen is to be
                                achieved. Taking into account turnover, extra commitments, sickness and
                                holidays, supervisors must develop a rota to meet the business’ requirements
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Commodities</strong> – the failure of the supervisor to correctly forecast the amount of
                                commodities for the kitchen output would be an embarrassment, as well as poor
                                business practice. Supervisors need to consider all kitchen output and
                                communicate effectively with suppliers to ensure requirements are met
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Other resources</strong> – these will be dependent on the requirement from the
                                professional kitchen. For example, a BBQ would require other resources, such as
                                BBQ stands/ gas/coals/paper plates/plastic KFS/cold storage etc.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>As a supervisor it is essential that you understand what <strong>you</strong> can do about challenges in the work environment.

                                    <li><strong>Staff</strong> – staff problems can be alleviated by discussing issues; asking staff to
                                        work on day off (consider their welfare); the use of temporary staff and, as a
                                        last resort, reducing the workload

                                    <li><strong>Commodities</strong> – if more commodities are required use your supplier network;
                                        approach business colleagues; buy from local suppliers; change the menu. If
                                        commodities are poor consider your procurement plan

                                    <li><strong>Other resources</strong> – if required, these can be obtained from local suppliers or
                                        even online. However, you may be limited in what you can achieve, due to time
