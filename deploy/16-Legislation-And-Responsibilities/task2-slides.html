                            <p><strong>Healthy carriers</strong><br />These people are carrying the bacteria but show no signs of illness. This type may well be

                                    <li>Protected from the weather – both sunlight and rain</li>
                                    <li>Oil storage should also include procedures for spillages, including spill kits and drip trays</li>

                                </ul>

                    </div>

                    <p>Food businesses must also consider a procedure to collect oil waste from grease traps and ensure any contractor complies with this procedure.</p>

                    <p>There are many pests that want to gain access to the professional kitchen. If they succeed, this may damage the
                        reputation and name of the business. Some of these pests include:</p>

                    <p><strong>Rodents</strong><br />This includes rats and mice; they carry bacteria on their bodies and urinate continuously. Signs they are
                        present include smear marks, droppings, smell, doors and equipment that have been gnawed. A mouse only needs a hole
                        as large as its head to gain access.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cockroaches</strong><br />Cockroaches in the UK include the German and American cockroach varieties. Both prefer the dark and
                        often hide in walls and machinery in a kitchen. Signs of infestation include an unpleasant smell, larvae and
                        sightings in the kitchen. Their bodies are generally covered in bacteria and they infect anything they touch.</p>

                    <p><strong>Insects</strong><br />Insects include flies, ants, weevils and other flying insects. These pests are normally seen in the kitchen or, in the case of weevils, in storerooms and the products kept in them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Domestic pets</strong><br />These pets carry harmful pathogenic bacteria on their fur and coats. It is also in their urine and on their tongues when they lick people.</p>

                    <p><strong>Birds</strong><br />Birds can be seen and they also leave evidence through their droppings. They carry bacteria such as e-coli and salmonella.</p>

                    <p><strong>Wild cats</strong><br />Wild cats carry all manner of pathogenic bacteria. Due to their living habits, they may carry clostridium perfringens, salmonella and clostridium botulinum from soil.</p>

                            <p>In order for the professional chef to control pests that might get into their kitchen, they need to design
                                methods to prevent entry or to eradicate them if they do enter. This can be achieved through:</p>

                            <p><strong>Writing a pest control policy</strong><br />This policy should direct management, supervisors and staff in how to plan,
                                monitor and deal with pest control. The policy should include at its core the need for a clean-as-you-go to
                                reduce food available for pests.</p>

                            <p><strong>Building maintenance</strong><br />Food businesses should ensure that access is denied to pests through a good maintenance programme, employing self-closing doors, fly screening and a clear path around the building for visual inspections. The use of electronic fly killers can also be employed.</p>

                            <p>In today’s environment the prevention and eradication of pests should be left to professionals. The methods
                                they employ will help a food business identify, remove and monitor pests. They will also provide a reporting
                                structure for a food business to prove due diligence has taken place.</p>

                            <p>Pest controllers will use:</p>
