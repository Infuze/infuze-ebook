                            <p>As a chef working in a professional kitchen, you will use a number of large pieces of equipment. The
                                equipment you use will depend on the size and nature of the establishment.</p>

                            <p>It is important to use equipment that is of good quality and best fits your needs. You need a basic
                                knowledge of how it operates; it is also beneficial to be familiar with the various models available. The
                                information below should be helpful in selecting and maintaining your large equipment.</p>

                            <p>It is important when using large equipment that you are fully trained and fully understand how to use it
                                safely.</p>

                                            <li>It is important when using deep fat fryers that you are able to control the temperature and
                                                allow for different settings for various types of food. Temperature controls may have ranges

                                            <li><strong>Salamander:</strong> direct dry heat source at the top of the equipment, often used to finish and

                                            <li><strong>Induction:</strong> An induction hob uses electromagnetism to create a magnetic field between the
                                                pan and the hob. Induction hobs are quicker and cheaper to run because the heat is
                                                transferred directly to the pan.

                                            <li><strong>Solid top:</strong> Solid tops are usually either powered by gas or electricity and heat a solid
                                                plate which distributes the heat. These can take a while to heat up and are less
                                                controllable than gas open-range hobs.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Open range:</strong> Open-range hobs are powered by gas; they provide instant, direct and
                                                controllable heat.

                                            <li><strong>Conventional, fan assisted (convection):</strong> A type of oven that uses convection currents to
                                                cook food. Fans are used to distribute hot air around the oven, which helps to cook the food
                                                more evenly and quickly than in a conventional gas-style oven. Usually contains two heating
                                                elements; others contain a heating element which is built around the fan so the air flows to
                                                a specific temperature level, keeping the air not only circulating but heating uniformly as
                                                well.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Combination (steam/dry heat), microwave):</strong> A combination-style oven allows a mixture of dry
                                                and wet heat. This is useful usually when using dough products or when the kitchen has
                                                limited space to have both a steamer and a oven.

                                        heats the water it up to a precise temperature, often used to âsous videâ a product.Â Using a water

                                        juices from the food as it cooks. A griddle will have an adjustable heat control, so they can be
                                        used for cooking food or keeping food warm. They are useful for a variety of tasks such as cooking

                                by manufacturers in order to understand how best to use large kitchen equipment.Â Manuals and guides inform
                                users about equipment specifications. Without this information, the chef may not understand how to operate
                                or clean the equipment.

                                Maintenance (PPM). All equipment in a professional catering kitchen should be serviced at least once a year
                                and some equipment more often, according to the manufacturerâs guidelines. Maintenance work should only be
                                undertaken by those who are competent to do the work and who have been provided with sufficient information,
                                instruction and training.

                            <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> A spotless and clean professional kitchen is extremely important for health and food safety
                                reasons. The best approach to cleaning large equipment in a professional kitchen is to divide the job into a
                                series of smaller tasks. Cleaning should be undertaken on a regular basis; this will help to prolong the
                                life of the kitchen equipment and prevent injury or damage to the kitchen.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring temperatures:</strong> It is important that the temperatures of certain kitchen equipment such as
                                fridges, freezers and hot and cold holding equipment are monitored on a regular basis. This will prevent
                                damage to the equipment and food spoilage occurring. Fridges and freezers should ideally be checked around
                                three times a day to ensure that they are operating at the correct temperature.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Reporting problems or damage:</strong> Any problems or damage should be reported to your supervisor immediately. Do
                                not attempt to fix or use the equipment if it is damaged, as it can lead to injuries.
