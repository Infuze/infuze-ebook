                                    <li>‘Farina’ is the Latin term for flour. This group includes dishes made with
                                        flour or that have high starch content.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Farinaceous dishes are an excellent source of carbohydrates and dietary fibre
                                        and are the equivalent of potatoes in many ethnic cuisines.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Many farinaceous items are good for you as they are low glycaemic index foods,
                                        meaning their energy is released gradually.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Italians are famed for their farinaceous items, with shaped, tubular, strand,
                                        ribbon, soup and stuffed varieties of pasta; different types of gnocchi are now
                                        popular around the Western world.

                                    <li><strong>Polished rice</strong> (white rice) has the outer husks removed and has no traces of
                                        rice flour.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Brown rice</strong> contains the bran, has a nutty flavour and consistency and is more
                                        nutritious. It takes longer to cook as the husk needs to soften.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Short-grain</strong> and <strong>medium-grain rice</strong>  has a rounder-shaped grain that absorbs more
                                        moisture as the outer starch or amylopectin is broken down gently as the liquid
                                        is absorbed. This is the reason for using it in risotto and sweet applications.
                                        Good rice such as Arborio or carnaroli will soften but retain its shape and
                                        firmer centre.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Parboiled rice</strong> has been pre-cooked, which thickens the starch and provides
                                        firmer rice that does not stick together. It may take a bit longer to cook than
                                        white rice.

                                    <li><strong>Red rice</strong> is a fermented rice made in Asia that is soaked and mixed with yeast
                                        <em>monascus purpureus</em> which gives it a rich red colour. It can be cooked like
                                        ordinary white rice but takes longer as it contains the husk. The French red
                                        rice grown in the Camargue in the south of France is a short-grain variety that
                                        has a natural red pigment in the husk.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Black rice</strong> is a very glutinous rice often used for sweet dishes. The black
                                        colour turns into a rich purple, combining well with coconut milk used in the
                                        recipe. Cooking time is extended as it includes the husk but soaking the rice
                                        prior to cooking will reduce the cooking time to 20–30 minutes. It can also be
                                        used for savoury applications.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Wild rice</strong> is an aquatic grass harvested in North America, with a firm outer
                                        layer and a chewy texture once cooked. It will expand considerably and is often
                                        mixed with other rice due to its cost.

                                    <li>In commercial kitchens, <strong>hen’s eggs</strong> are the most commonly used type. They are
                                        available in a range of sizes or grades, such as large (50–58.9g), extra large
                                        (59–66.9g) and jumbo (67–71.9g).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Sizes vary between suppliers – all suppliers must state the minimum weight of
                                        the eggs. The carton label can also be used as an indicator of egg size. Each
                                        country has slightly different size descriptors.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Eggs can also be purchased in cartons but also in trays containing 20 or 30
                                        eggs per tray. Caterers can purchase boxes of eggs, or egg products, such as
                                        whites or egg pulp.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Remember, for pastry recipes, it is sometimes necessary to weigh the eggs,
                                        rather than simply placing in the required number. In general most recipes
                                        assume a large egg.

                                    <li><strong>Semolina</strong> is the coarsely milled endosperm of durum wheat which may used for
                                        pasta production but also in breakfast cereals, dumplings, puddings and
                                        desserts.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Durum wheat</strong> semolina has a richer yellow colour whilst softer flours have
                                        whiter grains. In general it is rained into the liquid (usually milk) with a
                                        firm final product requiring a ratio of 1 part semolina to 5 parts liquid.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Once the semolina is cooked out for 2–3 minutes it is then set with egg yolks
                                        and chilled in a greased or lined tray. It can also be used in cakes and goes
                                        well with lemon.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The set mixture is cut into even shapes and fried. Cinnamon sugar is often used
                                        to add extra flavour. The hot semolina slices are served with fresh fruit or
                                        compote.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>For a softer textured pudding use a ratio of 1:10 parts semolina to liquid.
                                        Spices are added for flavour and dried fruit is also perfect for extra texture.

                                    <li>A ratio of 1:1 or 1:1.5 parts couscous to liquid is usually used (so for 1 kg
                                        of couscous then 1kg or litre to 1 or 1.5kg/lt of water will be used).

                                    <li>Couscous is traditionally steamed in a couscoussière where the bottom pot

                                    <li>Noodles are products made from any type of flour dough which is boiled in a
                                        liquid. The word noodle is derived from the German word ‘Nudel’ which is a
                                        common term used for all pasta and noodle types.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Noodles can be made from any flour type with the addition of eggs or water but
                                        wheat flour is one of the most commonly used bases. Wheat-based noodles are as
                                        diverse as traditional egg noodles, ramen and yakisoba noodles. Chinese
                                        varieties include mee pok and lamian noodles, whilst the Japanese udon noodles
                                        are a staple for a vast array of dishes.

                                    <li>Rice noodles are made into flat or thick shapes and are popular throughout Asia
                                        and India. Chinese he fen and rice vermicelli are popular in soups or salads.
                                        Mung bean or cellophane noodles are popular in Korea, Japan and China where they
                                        are often part of stir fries such as the Korean japchae.

                                        dumplings, or based on grated potatoes or leftover bread rolls such as Austrian-

                                        rice noodle paste, or encased in yeast dough such as red bean dumplings. Dim sum
                                        and the accompanying sauces such as chilli dip or soy sauce are popular at yum

                        Introduction to grains of the world
                    </h1>



                    <p><strong>Amaranth</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1">

                        <div class="page-col-2-2" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Like quinoa, amaranth is technically considered not a grain – it is the seed of the amaranth plant. Amaranth is gluten-free, high in protein, and contains lysine (making it a complete protein). Amaranth grains can be cooked whole in a pot, rice cooker or pressure cooker for a breakfast porridge or savoury ‘polenta’.</p>

                        </div>

                    </div>




                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Barley</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col reverse-order">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Barley has an especially tough hull, which when stripped removes some of the bran. There are hull-less varieties, most commonly found in natural-food stores and by mail order. Scotch barley and barley groats retain more of their bran than pearled barley. Barley contains beta-glucan, a soluble fibre attributed to lowering cholesterol, and protein comparable to wheat. It is not gluten-free. Barley is a versatile grain, good in soups, risottos and grain salads.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="page-col-2-2">
                            <img src="images/c10_t1_s4_2.jpg">
                        </div>

                    </div>




                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Buckwheat</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1">
                            <img src="images/c10_t1_s4_3.jpg">
                        </div>

                        <div class="page-col-2-2" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>The name buckwheat is a misnomer, as this grain is neither a wheat nor a buck; buckwheat seeds (or berries) come from a flowering plant in the rhubarb family. Kasha (or kashi) are toasted buckwheat groats (grain kernels that have their tough outer hull removed), most commonly cooked into hot cereal. Buckwheat flour makes tasty pancakes, blinis and bread. It is the primary ingredient in soba noodles. Gluten-free.</p>

                        </div>

                    </div>



                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Cracked wheat and bulgur wheat</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col reverse-order">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Cracked wheat is made by milling raw wheat berries into smaller pieces (‘cracking’), a process that reduces cooking time but still preserves the nutrient- and fibre-rich bran and germ layers. Bulgur is pre-cooked: wheat berries are parboiled, dried then broken into pieces. This makes a quicker-cooking grain with a nuttier flavour that is featured in popular Middle-Eastern dishes such as tabbouleh/tabouli and kibbeh. High in fibre, bulgur is not gluten-free. It makes great salads, pilafs, and side dishes; substitute bulgur for rice if you’re short on time, as an accompaniment to stir-fries, curries or stews.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="page-col-2-2">
                            <img src="images/c10_t1_s4_4.jpg">
                        </div>

                    </div>





                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Farro</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1">

                        <div class="page-col-2-2" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Farro by another name would be wheat; it’s an ancient Italian strain called ‘emmer’. Choose semi-perlato (semi-pearled) over perlato (pearled), as it has more bran intact. Farro is easily confused with spelt berries; some cooks use them interchangeably. Farro is easy to cook: add it to a pot of boiling water, cook until tender (20 to 30 minutes), then drain. Add cooked farro to sautéed leeks for a simple side dish or turn it into a salad.</p>

                        </div>

                    </div>






                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Kamut</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col reverse-order">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Kamut is the only grain with a trademark and because of the trademark it’s always organic. It’s an ancient, or heirloom, wheat grown in Montana. It’s high in protein and vitamin E. Some describe it as buttery and sweet. As grits, it makes a tasty hot cereal. You’ll find it in every form you find wheat: berries, cracked, rolled, flakes, puffed and ground into flour.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="page-col-2-2">

                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Millet</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1">

                        <div class="page-col-2-2" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Millet, gluten-free and comparable to wheat in protein, is a popular grain throughout the world, except in the United States, where it is mostly sold to stock bird feeders and throw at newly- weds. In the pot, however, millet is a mild-tasting, versatile grain, one that benefits from a bit of toasting beforehand. Cook millet into breakfast porridge or grits, savoury side dishes, croquettes and meat-free terrines.</p>

                        </div>

                    </div>




                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Oat groats</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1">
                            <img src="images/c10_t1_s4_8.jpg">

                        <div class="page-col-2-2" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Oat groats are hulled oat kernels, in their purest form before rolled, steel-cut, or milled into flour. Unlike many grains, oats are rarely processed to remove their germ and bran, making them a whole grain in most permutations. Higher in protein than most types of wheat, oats contain B vitamins and beta-glucan, a soluble fibre attributed with cholesterol-lowering properties. Sweet and nutty, oat groats make a delicious breakfast: boil one part oats to two parts water for about 40 minutes.</p>

                        </div>

                    </div>





                    <p style="border-top: solid 1px #cccccc; padding-top:10px"><strong>Polenta</strong></p>
                    <div class="page-2col reverse-order">

                        <div class="page-col-2-1" style="flex: 2;">

                            <p>Polenta and grits are both ground corn. They differ in how they’re ground (both the method and the fineness of the grind). Avoid de-germinated cornmeal (the germ has been removed to increase its shelf life), as it’s not a whole grain. Polenta makes a delicious base for sauces (ragu, mushroom, gorgonzola) and sausages. It’s also good grilled or layered into lasagne-like dishes.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="page-col-2-2">

                            <p>Corn or popcorn stands alone as a grain because it’s eaten both fresh and dried. Corn in America is treated like a vegetable. It is recognised as a grain by its derivatives: cornbread, tortillas, hominy, polenta and grits. Popcorn kernels are the grain in its entirety — truly a whole grain, offering a good fix of protein and fibre. Two cups of popcorn yield a serving of grains and a tasty snack.</p>

                            <p>Quinoa is the wonder grain: high in protein, gluten-free, easy to digest and quick to cook. Be sure to rinse it before cooking; quinoa is coated in saponin, a natural bitter-tasting insect repellent. Rinse and drain it, then cook it like pasta (in a large pot of boiling water) or rice (2 parts water to 1 part grain). It makes a delicious breakfast (with sweet or savoury additions), pilaf and salad. It can also be added to baked goods.</p>

                            <p>You may not be familiar with sorghum molasses, which, as it turns out, is made from the non-grain variety of sorghum. The grain variety of sorghum is a good source of protein and is gluten-free. Similar to millet in texture, sorghum benefits from being toasted first before cooking. Sorghum can be cooked into porridge, ground into flour for baking, or popped like popcorn. Heat a small amount of oil in a pot, add sorghum, cover and cook until all the grains are popped.</p>

                            <p>Spelt, a variety of hard wheat, is higher in protein than more common varieties of wheat. It can be interchanged with most wheat recipes, as berries (think grain salad) or flour (try pancakes). To cook spelt berries, soak them overnight first or do a quick soak by pouring boiling water over the berries and allowing them to sit for an hour. Simmer the soaked berries in a covered pot (1 cup berries to 2.5 cups water) until tender, 30 to 40 minutes. Frika or gruenkern is a green (as in unripe) spelt with a smoky flavour.</p>

                            <p>The name ‘teff’ refers to the grain’s miniscule size; teff comes from the word ‘teffa’ or ‘lost’ in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia. Teff is a kind of millet that possesses more iron and calcium than other whole grains, as well as all eight essential amino acids. Whole teff can be cooked into porridge or polenta-like dishes, as well as being added to baked goods. Teff flour is the primary ingredient of injera, a spongy Ethiopian flatbread.</p>

                            <p>Triticale is a hybrid of rye and durum wheat and possesses more protein and amino acids than either of these individual grains. Because it’s easily grown without pesticides and commercial fertilizers, it’s a poster child for sustainable and organic farming. The question remains, though: what do you do with it? Substitute triticale berries for other wheat and rye berries in salads, soups and stews. Rolled triticale can be cooked like oatmeal or folded into a batch of granola or flapjacks.</p>

                            <p>Arborio is the most widely available Italian rice. Considered a medium grain, it is popular in risotto and is suitable for pilafs and rice puddings too. When making risotto or pilafs, fry the grains briefly in oil or fat to keep the grains separate when cooked. Italian rices are graded according to quality. Buy the top grade, ‘superfino’, for risotto.</p>

                            <p>This medium-grain rice from Italy is difficult to grow. It has a high starch content that allows it to absorb liquids and flavours while keeping its shape. It resists overcooking and yields a creamy consistency that makes it the preferred rice for classic risotto.</p>

                            <p>A short grain rice, the is the Spanish rice traditionally used to make paella rice. It’s different from other short-grain rices because it absorbs moisture without breaking down; when fully cooked, the individual grains of rice remain whole. Arborio and another medium grained Italian rice can be used as a substitute but will yield a creamier dish. Use Valencia rice to stuff dolmas or other vegetables.</p>

                            <p>The most versatile of all rices, white long-grain rice is the standard rice consumed in North America.

                            <p>Brown rice has the germ and bran intact, making it rich in fibre, minerals and vitamins. Most rices are available in white or brown varieties but as it is a whole grain, brown rice is considered a healthier choice than white. Long-grain brown rice is high in amylose, resulting in a firmer, more absorbent kernel when cooked. Cooked long-grain rices are therefore fluffier than short-grain rices.</p>

So aromatic it was named after the sweet-smelling jasmine flower, this rice has clear crystalline grains and cooks to a soft, slightly clingy texture. Hom mali, a strongly scented hybrid developed in Thailand, is widely available in Asian markets in the United States. Jasmine rice is the ideal rice for fried rice.</p>

                            <p>An aromatic rice, basmati grows in the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India and Pakistan, as well as some parts of the US. It is a very long, needle-shaped rice, and elongates even more when cooked. Basmati is available white or brown (usually American-grown) and is ideal for north Indian and Persian cooking, since the grains stay separate and firm when cooked. Use it for biryanis or tahdig (a Persian rice dish with a crispy bottom), or pair it with South Asian curries. Dehra dun from India is the most prized of the basmati varieties and is available at well-stocked South Asian markets.</p>

                            <p>This rice is just as nutritious as its long-grain cousin but has a chewy, stickier texture because it possesses more amylopectin.

Although the grains still separate when cooked, this rice has a stickier texture in comparison to long-grain rice. That’s why it’s often called sticky rice. Rice grown in Japan is not exported. Traditionally, Japanese rice is washed until the water rinses clear, then drained before cooking.</p>

The cooked rice is pale pink with a soft and slightly clingy texture. Other countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, and India (Kerala red rice is needle-thin and long like basmati) also produce similar red rices. Because it is semi-milled, it cooks in about 20 minutes.</p>

                            <p>In ancient China, black rice was considered the finest grain, reserved for the emperor. Hence its trademarked name of ‘Forbidden Rice’. Rich in anthocyanins and antioxidants, this medium-size heirloom rice has a dark purple colour and also contains more vitamin B, niacin, vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc than white rice. Grown in northern China, black rice is traditionally made into congee but its roasted nutty taste is delicious in salads and fried rice too. A whole grain, black rice has a white kernel underneath the black-coloured bran layer. Cook it as you would brown rice.</p>

                            <p>At the Asian market, this rice is often sold in bags labelled ‘malagkit’, its Tagalog name, even though the rice most likely comes from Thailand. In the Philippines, malagkit is cooked in coconut milk and then wrapped in banana leaves. Also a staple in northern Thailand and Laos, it is served with curries and grilled meats, and as a dessert of sticky rice with mango. Before cooking (steaming is the ideal method), wash the raw rice well and soak it overnight.</p>

                            <p>Wild rice is technically not a grain but the seed of an aquatic grass. It is high in protein and dietary fibre and low in fat. It’s also a good source of minerals and B vitamins. Native to the Great Lakes region, as well as the Gulf Coasts, wild rice is now cultivated in California and Oregon. Wild rice can be eaten on its own or blended with other rices. Try it in salads, stuffings and pilafs. Using a 1:3 rice-to-water ratio, cook wild rice in a large saucepan of lightly salted boiling water until tender, 45 to 55 minutes. Drain.</p>
